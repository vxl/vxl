        Remove vcl_complex hackery on MSVC 6. vcl_complex is now the
        standard <complex>, since it seems to work with VC6sp5.

        vnl_numeric_limits is deprecated in favour of vcl_numeric_limits. (vnl_n_l was written before vcl. vcl_n_l is now more robust, and can use platform defaults)
        vbl_basic_tuple, vbl_basic_relation, etc. are deprecated since we have no decent explanation of how to use them.
