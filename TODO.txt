VXL To Do List
--------------

This file lists ideas for enhancements that would be helpful to VXL
and is essentially a simple bug and feature request tracker.

Maintainers should feel free to add new items and to add comments or
suggestions to any of these items.  Make sure you keep the file well
organized.

When someone works on or completes one of these tasks, make a note of
that in this file.  If that marks a significant improvement, make an
entry in the CHANGES.txt file as well.

* upgrade netlib to use LAPACK instead of LINPACK

vnl_algo uses the netlib library to provide good numerical algorithms.
During VNL's design, it was though that the much newer LAPACK was better
than the LINPACK library. However, it was faster to get something working
with LINPACK, since it had less dependencies than LAPACK. Now, LAPACK's
superiority is undisputed. LAPACK is faster, and more accurate.

Note that vnl does not use BLAS, but does its own vector and matrix
multiplications. The speed of the MKL (An Intel supplied/optimised copy
of BLAS) was compared with gcc's compilation of VNL, and gcc/VNL won.
gcc/VNL was marginally faster on the matrix-vector operations, although
the difference was more marked on the vector-vector operations.
However, LAPACK and LINPACK both need a BLAS, and the MKL 
was definitely faster than the gcc-compiled version of the default BLAS
currently in netlib. So it would be worth providing an option to use an
external BLAS for vnl_algo/netlib. It might also be worth testing the
matrix-matrix operations - where MKL's knowledge of cache behaviour
may help more than vnl's knowledge of the matrix data organisation.
See https://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=3628964 for
more details.

* vnl specializations for char

From Brad King: There no specializations for char types in vnl.

* vnl, mix of static methods and static constants for constants

From Brad King: In vnl Some of the constants are static methods and
some are static constants.  I do not see any reason for the
inconsistency.

* vnl min/max values for long types are hardcoded to assume 32-bits

From Brad King: In vnl, min/max values for long types are hardcoded to
assume 32-bits.  It should be possible to construct almost all the
values with try-run programs during the configuration process, but
that may be overkill for now.

* vnl, test_math and test_numeric_limits access the NaN values

From Brad King: In vnl, another problem is that test_math and
test_numeric_limits access the NaN values.  There is nothing wrong
with this, but Borland throws floating-point exceptions by default.
I've fixed my local copy to use the _control87 function to disable
exceptions for those tests on that compiler, but I haven't committed
it yet.  Is this something we want to abstract and add to testlib?

From Peter Vanroose: A similar problem on Alpha (OSF).  I've commented
out the affected tests, but that's not really the best way to proceed.
So it's not just Borland C++, and it would indeed be nice to have an
elegant solution for this.

From Brad King: We could just put the floating point exception disable
code in the top of testlib_main just like the crtdbg stuff for getting
rid of the MSVC popup dialogs.  Once we get it working everywhere with
a bunch of #ifdef lines then we could consider making it a function
somewhere useful outside testing.

* vcl and CMake try-compile

Bill Hoffman has suggested that a lot of the compiler version based
#ifdefs in vcl could be replaced by the CMake try-compile mechanism.

* CVS server file execute permissions wrong

At the CVS server, remove execute permission from files that should
not have it.  There is not way to do this with CVS commands, except
possibly a remove and add, which we should avoid.  This could be done
at the same time as any other direct repository modification.
