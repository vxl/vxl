	* rules.mk: `public' variable CLEAN added, which, if set, makes sure
	  that object files are removed after successfully building a library
	  or executables.  Saves disk space, but only useful for infrequent
	  builds.  Uses the internal variable CLEAN_FILES for the list of
	  files to be removed after successful building.

	* params.mk: Move USE_TEMPLATES to rules.mk.  This is OK as
	  the user can override it by defining it before rules.mk is
	  included.
