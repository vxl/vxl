# Find a JPEG library

# This file is used to manage using either a natively provided JPEG library or the one in v3p if provided.

# As per the standard scheme the following definitions are used
# JPEG_INCLUDE_DIR - where to find jpeglib.h
# JPEG_LIBRARIES   - the set of libraries to include to use JPEG.
# JPEG_FOUND       - TRUE, if available somewhere on the system.

# Additionally
# VXL_USING_NATIVE_JPEG  - True if we are using a JPEG library provided outside vxl (or v3p)

# If this FORCE variable is unset or is FALSE, try to find a native library.
