#
# This open cl setup is based on the requirements for the AMD SDK.
# http://developer.amd.com/gpu/ATIStreamSDKBetaProgram/Pages/default.aspx
# Undoubtedly a different setup is required for the Nvidia SDK
#
# 3/14/2009 Support for both ATI and NVIDIA SDKs added by Octavian
# 4/06/2009 Force check of actual lib files in the path's provided using FIND_LIBRARY added by Octavian
