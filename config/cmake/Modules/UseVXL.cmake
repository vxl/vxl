# vxl/config/cmake/Modules/UseVXL.cmake
# (also copied by CMake to the top-level of the vxl build tree)
#
# This CMake file may be included by projects outside VXL.  It
# configures them to make use of VXL headers and libraries.  The file
# is written to work in one of two ways.
#
# The preferred way to use VXL from an outside project with UseVXL.cmake:
#
#  FIND_PACKAGE(VXL)
#  IF(VXL_FOUND)
#    INCLUDE(${VXL_CMAKE_DIR}/UseVXL.cmake)
#  ELSE(VXL_FOUND)
#    MESSAGE("VXL_DIR should be set to the VXL build directory.")
#  ENDIF(VXL_FOUND)
#
# Read vxl/config/cmake/VXLConfig.cmake for the list of variables
# provided.  The names have changed to reduce namespace pollution.
# The old names can be made available by placing this line before
# including UseVXL.cmake:
#
#  SET(VXL_PROVIDE_OLD_CACHE_NAMES 1)
#
# This UseVXL.cmake no longer adds options and testing features automatically
# to projects including it unless this line appears before including it:
#
#  SET(VXL_PROVIDE_STANDARD_OPTIONS 1)
#
# For example, in order to enable full backward-compatibility while
# still using FIND_PACKAGE, use these lines:
#
#  FIND_PACKAGE(VXL)
#  IF(VXL_FOUND)
#    SET(VXL_PROVIDE_OLD_CACHE_NAMES 1)
#    SET(VXL_PROVIDE_STANDARD_OPTIONS 1)
#    INCLUDE(${VXL_CMAKE_DIR}/UseVXL.cmake)
#  ELSE(VXL_FOUND)
#    MESSAGE("VXL_DIR should be set to the VXL build directory.")
#  ENDIF(VXL_FOUND)
#
# The old way to use VXL from an outside project with UseVXL.cmake is
# also supported for backward-compatibility:
#
#  SET(VXL_BINARY_PATH "" CACHE PATH "VXL build directory (location of UseVXL.cmake)")
#  IF(VXL_BINARY_PATH)
#    INCLUDE(${VXL_BINARY_PATH}/UseVXL.cmake)
#  ELSE(VXL_BINARY_PATH)
#    MESSAGE("VXL_BINARY_PATH should be set to the VXL build directory (location of UseVXL.cmake)" )
#  ENDIF(VXL_BINARY_PATH)
#

# If this file has been included directly by a user project instead of
# through VXL_USE_FILE from VXLConfig.cmake, simulate old behavior.
