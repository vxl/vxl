#   also configured by CMake to
# @vxl_BINARY_DIR@/VXLConfig.cmake
#
# This CMake module is configured by VXL's build process to export the
# project settings for use by client projects.  A client project may
# find VXL and include this module using the FIND_PACKAGE command:
#
#  FIND_PACKAGE(VXL)
#
# After this command executes, projects may test VXL_FOUND for whether
# VXL has been found.  If so, the settings listed below in this file
# have been loaded and are available for use.
#
# Typically, a client project will include UseVXL.cmake from the
# directory specified by the VXL_CMAKE_DIR setting:
#
#  FIND_PACKAGE(VXL)
#  IF(VXL_FOUND)
#    INCLUDE(${VXL_CMAKE_DIR}/UseVXL.cmake)
#  ELSE(VXL_FOUND)
#    MESSAGE("VXL_DIR should be set to the VXL build directory.")
#  ENDIF(VXL_FOUND)

# See vxl/config/cmake/UseVXL.cmake for details.
