# This CMakeLists.txt file handles the creation of files needed by
# other client projects that use VXL.  Nothing is built by this

# CMake after all the other CMakeLists.txt files in the VXL tree,
# which is why the add_subdirectory(config/cmake/export) command is at the end
# of the top level CMakeLists.txt file.
