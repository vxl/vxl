The TargetJr configuration FAQ.

./configure --help gives current options.  The interesting ones
   are the --with-* options that are at the end of the output.
   Those are the targetjr specific options.

configure: error: installation or configuration problem: C++ compiler cannot create executables.
  Remove config.cache and retry.  To configure for different machines,
   ./configure --cache-file=machine1
   ./configure --cache-file=machine2

I can't find the X includes.
  Add USE_RENDERING = 1 to your makefile.

I can't find the COOL includes.
  Make sure COOL is in your USES variable.

make: Nothing to be done for `XXX'.
  Where XXX is anything other than `all', and it's not a target
  in your makefile --- some chump has put a target rule in params.mk.
  Scold them and move it to rules.mk

configure: error: can not find sources in . or ..
  configure.in is missing, This should be in the directory that has configure.

make[1]: tjwd: Command not found
   Scripts/Shell and Scripts/Perl are not in your path.

I remove the library in $IUEOSTYPE and re-make, nothing happens, what is up?
   The libraries have been moved there is no longer a symlink from the
   directory with the .o files.  The library is built in the lib.$IUEOSTYPE directory
   of the package.

Why did my disk use double with the new makefiles?  See above question.
   If you remove all the libraries in the $IUEOSTYPE directories it should
   fix it.

Why does a packages have USE_foo and HAS_foo.  HAS_foo is set when the
   configure script finds foo, or is given foo on the command line for the
   system that is being built.   USE_foo is used in an individual makefile to
   be able to use those header files/ libraries when building those files.
   This is done so that the -I lines only have the packages being used by the
   code that needs it.

How do I make cpp- for a Templates file?  cd Templates; 
   make NODEPENDS=1 -f ../makefile cpp-Protection_IuBaseWindow.C
