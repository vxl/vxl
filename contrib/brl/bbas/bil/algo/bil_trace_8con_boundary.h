//: Trace 8-connected boundary around region in boolean image
//  Assumes that (i0,j0) is a boundary point.
//  Searches for the boundary pixels and runs around until it gets back to beginning.
//  On exit the boundary points are given by (bi[k],bj[k])
//
// Point to note: If (i0,j0) is in the middle of a 1 pixel wide line connecting
// two regions, then the point will occur twice in the list, once as the first
// point, then once in the middle of the list as we trace through it to get
// to the other side of the blob.
