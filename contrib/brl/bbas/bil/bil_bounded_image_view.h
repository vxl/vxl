//  The actual image data is contained in the parent of this class.
//  The parent has data (ni(), nj(), nplanes());
//  This view considers that data to be a region inside a larger image
//  space with an offset, (ib0(), jb0()),  the size of this view is
//  (nib(), njb()) and the same number of planes.
// The purpose of the bounded view is support uniform processing
// on a specified image space, even though only a variable portion
// of the image is valid. This situation arises, for example, in
// projecting a given 3-d region into a set of camera views of
// the region.
