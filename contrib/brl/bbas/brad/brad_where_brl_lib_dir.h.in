// \brief copied after the way VXL's vcl does
// Allows cmake to set up macro giving name of VXL root dir is

// Note: The make system (eg cmake) should generate a file, brad_where_brl_lib_dir.h in the library folder, from
// this, in which the macro is set correctly.
// For non-cmake systems this might cause a problem.  In particular if there is
// no brad_where_brl_lib_dir.h, some other stuff might not compile.
// If we supply a default brad_where_brl_lib_dir.h, it would be changed by cmake, and
// may get checked back into the repository by accident.
