/*! \mainpage vidl2 : Video Stream Library
* A stream-based rewrite of the vidl library
*
* \section introduction Introduction
* The purpose of this library is to provide a unified interface reading
* and writing video in VXL.  Unlike the previous vidl library, this library
* treats video as a data stream and builds directly on the vil image library.
* The two main classes are vidl2_istream for input streams and vidl2_ostream
* for output streams.
*
* This design has the following advantages over the old vidl library that
* treated videos as container objects.
*  - Better support for large video files
*  - Better support for encoding options
*  - Support for live video streams
*  - Better integration with vil
*
* \section streams Streams vs. Codecs
* Various stream subclasses are used to interface with different types of
* video streams.  Note that these are not called codecs.  The codec in the
* old vidl library was somewhat of a misnomer.  Each vidl2_istream and
* vidl2_ostream subclass is a wrapper for another video API that may or may
* not provide encoding, and may support many different codecs.  For example,
* vidl2_ffmpeg_istream provides a input using the FFMPEG library.  The FFMPEG
* library can open a large variety of video file formats (avi, mpeg, etc.)
* and decode using an even larger variety of codecs (MPEG2, MPEG4, MJPEG,
* H.264, Cinepak, etc.).
*
* The video stream design also allows for streams that receive images from live
* video feeds.  This could be from a camera, network video feed, or other source.
* Thus, video capture and video transcoding are both accomplished by directing
* an input stream into and output stream.
*
* \section types Stream Types
* The following is a list of streams that are currently implemented
*  - vidl2_image_list_istream : treats an ordered list of vil_image_resource_sptr
*    as a video stream.  Also supports reading a list of images from disk given
*    a list of filenames or a file glob.
*  - vidl2_image_list_ostream : writes a video to disk as a sequence of numbered
*    image files using any image file format supported by vil.
*  - vidl2_ffmpeg_istream : uses the <a href="http://ffmpeg.sourceforge.net/">
*    FFMPEG</a> library to decode many common video file formats.
*  - vidl2_ffmpeg_ostream : uses the <a href="http://ffmpeg.sourceforge.net/">
*    FFMPEG</a> library to encode to many common video file formats with
*    many encoding options for video quality and compression.
*  - vidl2_v4l_istream - use a video for Linux input stream
*  - vidl2_v4l_ostream - use a video for Linux output stream
*  - vidl2_dshow_live_istream - use the DirectShow API to stream video directly
*    from camera and frame-grabber devices in Windows using native Windows codecs.
*  - vidl2_dshow_file_istream - use the DirectShow API to encode video files
*    in Windows using native Windows codecs
*
* The following streams are currently under development
*  - vidl2_dc1394_istream - use libdc1394 to stream video directly from IEEE
*    1394 (firewire) based cameras (using Linux/BSD)
*
* The following streams sound useful but need someone to work on them
*  - vidl2_cmu1394_istream - use the CMU 1394 driver to stream video directly
*    from IEEE 1394 (firewire) based cameras (using Windows)
*  - vidl2_dv1394_istream - use libdv1394 to stream video from DV camcorders
*    over a 1394 DV connection (using Linux/BSD)
*  - vidl2_dv1394_ostream - use libdv1394 to stream video over a 1394 DV connection
*    to some other video device (using Linux/BSD)
*
* \section frames Video Frames
* The vidl2_frame_sptr is data structure used to transport video frame data from
* a vidl2_istream to a vidl2_ostream.  The vidl2_frame contains a pointer to the
* frame buffer, the image resolution, the pixel format, and may eventually contain
* a time stamp.  A vidl2_frame is more restrictive than a vil_image_view since it
* requires contiguous memory and is limited in pixel data types.  However, it also
* handles many pixels formats not supported by vil such as those with subsampled
* chrominance (i.e. YUV 4:2:2).
*
* In some cases the vidl2_frame data can be wrapped
* by a vil_image_view, but usually this is not a good idea.  The vidl2_frame should
* considered be volatile data structure.  The image buffer is only guaranteed to be
* valid until the next call of \c vidl2_ostream::advance().  The ostream will keep a
* pointer to the released frame and then invalidate it before reusing memory.  Use
* the functions in vidl2_convert.h to obtain a non-volatile vil_image_view.
*
* \section pix_fmt Pixel Formats and Conversions
* The supported pixel formats are enumerated in vidl2_pixel_format.  A set of
* template specializations is used to define a set of traits for each format.
* A new pixel format may be introduced by simply adding an entry in the table
* in vidl2_pixel_format.h.  The traits of a pixel format are used in the generation
* of conversion routines with templates.
*
* \section TODO List:
*
* \todo Settle on the stream API. Should the redundant read_frame() be
* removed? Can we handle all asynchronous streams with the synchronous
* API and an asynchronous buffering mechanism behind the scenes? The idea
* being that we want a simple API.
*
* \todo Add some notion of timestamps to the vidl2_frame. It seems
* like it would be useful to know when each frame was captured (maybe
* relative to the first frame), especially if you are allowing for
* dropped frames or capturing non-uniformly in time.
*
* \todo Improve conversion routines to and from vil_image_views.
*
* \todo Add support for more parameters in the 1394 camera standard.
*
* \todo Write a VXL book chapter for vidl2. This is required to
* promote vidl2 to core and ultimately replace vidl (which has a very
* limited book chapter). Also, it would be good to have a user's
* guide other than the Doxygen generated pages.
*
* \todo Decide on a standard (maybe XML?) for stream parameter files,
* and add code to read and write these files. This is related to the
* factory creation stuff. Should we push to put modern factory creation
* code in vbl?
*
* \todo Create an add-on GUI library to create vgui_menus for the
* parameter classes. This would allow users to easily create a GUI
* with vidl2 where the user can set the parameters for streaming.
*
* \todo Update vidl2/examples/vidl2_player to include all implemented
* streams. We'd like to have a single GUI demo application that can
* feed any istream to any ostream (provided they have been compiled
* into vidl2).
*
* \todo Update comments within the code. This includes the "advance but
* don't acquire" remark. This was intended for the case of file parsing
* where one can seek to another frame without decoding it, but is
* incorrect for live streams. Advanced Copy & paste techniques have
* spread the comment around ;-).
*
* \todo A DirectShow ostream should be added.
*
* \todo We'd like to create a DirectShow filter that replaces the
* ISampleGrabber currently used in the vidl2_dshow_istream family. This
* would remove the limitations imposed by the use of the ISampleGrabber
* and potentially could consolidate the file/live_istreams into a single
* vidl2_dshow_istream.
