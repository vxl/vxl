# Find an Expat library
#
#
# This file is used to manage using either a natively provided Expat library
# or the one in b3p if provided.
#
#
# As per the standard scheme the following definitions are used
# EXPAT_INCLUDE_DIR - where to find expat.h
# EXPAT_LIBRARIES   - the set of libraries to include to use Expat.
# EXPAT_FOUND       - TRUE, if available somewhere on the system.
# EXPATPP_INCLUDE_DIR - where to find expatpp.h
# EXPATPP_LIBRARIES   - the set of libraries to include to use ExpatPP.
# EXPATPP_FOUND       - TRUE, if available somewhere on the system.

# Additionally
# VXL_USING_NATIVE_EXPAT   - True if we are using an Expat library provided outside vxl (or b3p)
# VXL_USING_NATIVE_EXPATPP - True if we are using an ExpatPP library provided outside vxl (or b3p)

# If this FORCE variable is unset or is FALSE, try to find a native library.

  # will not have the b3p expat library, so make sure the headers
  # exist.
