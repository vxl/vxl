/*! \mainpage vpgl : Photogrammetry Library
* A set of classes to represent cameras and projections from 3-d geometry to 2-d geometry
*
* \section intro Introduction
* This library contains a hierarchy of camera classes derived from vpgl_camera.
* There are also classes to represent fundamental matrices (vpgl_fundamental_matrix), and
* lens distortions (vpgl_lens_distortion).
*
* This library is based on vgl and primarily manipulates vgl objects.  However, vnl is also
* as needed.  The add-on library vpgl_algo contains functions to estimate parameters of vpgl 
* objects.
