@section Data Collectors, and Data Wrappers.
The STL iterators are great general purpose devices - however they force
authors of new algorithms to write heavily templated code. This can prove
difficult for the user, and impossible for some compilers in the case of extra-templated
member functions. The mbl classes are templated, but on data-type, and this template parameter
doesn't have the same potential to confuse.

The purpose of the @code{mbl_data_collector} and @code{mbl_data_wrapper} are to provide similar
purpose as STL iterators, but using polymorphism, instead of templating to handle different types
of iterator. The descendants of @code{mbl_data_collector} provide something similar to an STL
output iterator. The descendants of @code{mbl_data_wrapper} provide something similar to an
STL input iterator.

@subsection Data Wrappers.

When reading data from an @code{mbl_data_wrapper}, you do not need to know which polymorphic
concrete type is being used. This way a client can pass you data from any source.
Reading data from an @code{mbl_data_wrapper} is straight forward.
@example
    vnl_vector<double> my_sum(mbl_data_wrapper<vnl_vector<double> >& data)
    @{
      data.reset();
      vnl_vector<double> sum = data.current();
      while (data.next())
        sum += data.current();
    @}
@end example

You can do random access, using the the @code{set_index(int n)} method, but there is no guarantee that
the underlying iterator supports this efficiently, so you should use sequential access where possible.
The wrappers themselves do not support IO, because they are only wrappers - they do not own the
wrapped data.

Currently there is only one concrete wrapper, @code{mbl_data_array_wrapper} which wraps C-style data
arrays. This can be used to wrap @code{vcl_vector}s. Wrappers have in the past been written to
read files of data directly from disk.

@subsection Data Collectors.

When writing data to an @code{mbl_data_collector}, you do not need to know which polymorphic
concrete type is being used. This way you can pass a client data in any way they choose.
Writing data to an @code{mbl_data_collector} is straight forward.
@example
    void my_random_data(mbl_data_collector<vnl_vector<double> >& data)
    @{
      // Create sampler
      vpdfl_axis_gaussian gaussian;
      gaussian.set(vnl_vector<double>(20,0.0),
                   vnl_vector<double>(20,1.0));
      vpdfl_sampler_base *sampler = gaussian.new_sampler();

      // set up stuff
      data.clear();
      vnl_vector<double> x;

      // put random samples in collector
      for (unsigned i=0 i<2000; ++i)
      @{
        sampler->sample(x);  // generate random sample
        data.record(x);     // record sample
      @}
    @}
@end example

You can store a collector using @code{vsl}, although if you want to store a polymorphic collector variable,
you will need to cast the pointer to a @code{mbl_data_collector_base}@footnote{Some Compilers
cannot cope with a mixture of templated base classes, template binary loader, and
explicit template instantiation.}.

You can create a mbl_data_wrapper from an @code{mbl_data_collector} by calling
@code{collector.data_wrapper()}.

There are two concrete data collectors - @code{mbl_data_collector_list} and
@code{mbl_stochastic_data_collector}. The former stores all the data given to it, whilst the
latter stores a fixed size complete random subset of all the data given to it. This is useful
if you do not know how much data an algorithm is going to produce, but for space or time reasons
you can only store and use subset of it.


@section Random Number Generator
@cindex vnl_random
@cindex mz_random

Rather than use @code{vnl_sample()}, @code{vnl_random}, provides a superior
random number generator.

@itemize
@item It should provide the same pseudo-random sequence whatever platform you are running
on.
@item It is based on an algorithm which is known to have less correlation between
adjacent samples, than some standard pseudo random number generators.
@item It has been thoroughly tested (See below for some examples.)
@end itemize.

The downside of vnl_random is that it is about 5 times slower than some other
pseudo-random number generators. For a discussion on speed/randomness trade-off see
@cite{Press et al. Numerical Recipes in C, Cambridge, 1992.}

@subsection The randomness of vnl_random (Advanced Topic)


I was using a @code{vpdfl_axis_gaussian_sampler} to produce some test data, and
there seemed to be too many outliers. I was worried about the randomness
of the @code{vnl_random::normal()}, so I ran some tests.

@subsubsection Tim's rank diagram test
@itemize
@item Sort the samples
@item plot rank vs @math{P(x' < x)}
@item i.e. plot i vs @math{0.5*(1+vcl_erf(x/vcl_sqrt(2.0))}
@end itemize

@image{mbl_mz_random_graph1,,}

This seems normal.

@subsubsection Testing specifically for outliers.

For a seed of 123456, the numbers of outliers at 1, 2, 3, and 4 s.d.
were all greater than the expected value. This bias was reduced
but still evident when the number of samples was increased from 10^4 to 10^5 and 10^6.

The results for a key of  9667566 are
@example
Got 3183 samples outside 1 sd- expected3174
Got 463 samples outside 2 sd- expected455
Got 28 samples outside 3 sd- expected27.5
Got 0 samples outside 4 sd- expected0.6
@end example

These seem @emph{more normal}.

@subsubsection Testing distribution of outliers separations.

One further possibility is that there might be correlation between adjacent samples. So
I counted the separations (number of samples) between outliers (those that exceeded 2 standard
deviations), and plotted the distribution of intervals, along with the expected distribution.
The first graph is for a seed of 123456, and the second for a seed of 9667566.
(Note: The key on the following two graphs is reversed.)

@image{mbl_mz_random_graph2,,}
@image{mbl_mz_random_graph3,,}

@subsubsection Conclusions

There does not appear to be a persistent bias in the number of outliers as
the seed is modified.

A seed of 123456 does seem to give more outliers than expected, and in particular
gives more adjacent outliers that expected - which can have significant effects
on 2-D test data set generation.

Use a different seed 9667566

@section Miscellaneous
@table @code

@item mbl_cloneable_ptr
Almost the opposite of a vbl_smart_ptr, this class acts like a pointer,
but performs a deep copy of the referenced object when the pointer itself is copied.
Supports IO via @code{vsl}.

@item mbl_chord
Describes a horizontal line on a image.

@item mbl_priority_bounded_queue
This acts like a vcl_priority_queue, but only stores the n least values, where n
is the configurable bound.

@item mbl_stats_1d, mbl_sum_1d
Calculate, store, and manipulate running statistics and sums.

@item mbl_lda
Calculate, manipulate and use a Linear Discriminant Analysis of data.

@item mbl_gamma.h
Complete and incomplete gamma functions

@item mbl_k_means.h
Perform k means clustering.

@item mbl_matrix_products.h, mbl_matxvec.h
Perform various linear algebra operations.

@item mbl_print.h
Commands that debuggers can run easily on demand. Include this file
in your application, and you call these functions from a debugger to
display common containers.
@end table


@section Further Development
@subsection Other Algorithms.
It would be useful to have several random number generators all with a similar
interface to @code{vnl_random}. Adding an abstract base class, would allow the
use of the strategy pattern - for instance swapping in a more random generator.

@subsection Input/Output
Since the random number generator has a real state, it could be useful to be able
to save  that state to a @code{vsl_b_istream}.

@subsection Move contents to VXL
With a bit more development some of this code could be usefully moved into @VXL .
e.g. @example
mbl_chord -> vil1_chord,
mbl_gamma.h -> vnl_gamma.h,
mbl_priority_bounded_queue.h -> vbl_priority_bounded_queue,
etc.
@end example
