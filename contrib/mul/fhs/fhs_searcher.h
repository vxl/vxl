// \brief Use F&H's DP style algorithm to search for global solutions

#include <fhs/fhs_arc.h>
#include <vgl/vgl_fwd.h> // for point_2d<T>
#include <vimt/vimt_image_2d_of.h>

//: Use F&H's DP style algorithm to search for global solutions to model match
//  Model consists of a set of features, together with a tree of neighbour
//  relationships of the form pos(j) = pos(i) + (N(mx,var_x),N(my,var_y))
//  where N(m,var) is a gaussian with mean m and variance var.
//
//  The aim is to find a set of points {p(i)} which minimise
//  sum_i F_i(p(i)) + sum_k shape_cost(arc(k))
//  where k indexes the set of arcs defining neighbour relationships,
//  and shape_cost(arc) = dx*dx/arc.var_x + dy*dy.var_y  (dx=p(arc_j).x()-p(arc_i).x()-arc.mx)
//  This is achieved using a combination of a quadratic distance function
//  applied to each feature response image F(i), and a dynamic programming
//  approach to combining the data.
//
//  Algorithm based on papers by Felzenszwalb and Huttenlocher on
//  Pictoral Structure Matching.
