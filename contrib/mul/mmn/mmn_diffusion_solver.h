//: Run diffusion algorithm to solve max sum problem
// See  T Werner. A Linear Programming Approach to Max-sum problem: A review;
// IEEE Trans on Pattern Recog & Machine Intell, July 2007
// Try and solve the max-sum problem by performing node-pencil averaging over the graph
// I.e. transform to equivalent problem by adding "potentials" to nodes and subtracting them
// from arcs. This is done to equalise node costs and the cost of the maximal connecting arcs
// If this converges the solution is to take the maximal nodes (which will then be arc-consistent).
