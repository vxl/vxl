/*! \mainpage vimt : Polymorphic image + transform library
* Provides a set of image classes, derived from vimt_image, which can be used
* as `registered views' on actual image data.
*
* The vimt classes use vil_image_view to provide that actual 2d images, and
* a vimt_transform_2d object to provide the registration.
*
* The most commonly used classes are likely to be vimt_image_2d_of<T> and
* vimt3d_image_3d_of<T> templated multi-plane images.
*
* \section pyr Image Pyramids
* Image pyramids (vimt_image_pyramid) are stacks of images, assumed to have lower
* resolution as one goes up the stack.
*
* They can be build using vimt_image_pyramid_builder objects such as
* - vimt_gaussian_pyramid_builder_2d
* - vimt_gaussian_pyramid_builder_2d_general
*
* \section Sampling Sampling
* Profiles can be sampled using vimt_sample_profile_bilin
*
* \section Expansion Expansion
* There is nothing to stop you using the basic vimt_image class to provide
* your own 2d image class. Two possible reasons for this would be to use a
* much more general transform type, or to use a vil_image_resource as
* the underlying image type.
