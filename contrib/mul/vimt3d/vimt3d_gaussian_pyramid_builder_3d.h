//: Build Gaussian pyramids of vimt3d_image_3d_of<T>
//  Smooth with a Gaussian filter (1-5-8-5-1 by default)
//  and subsample so that image at level i-1 is half the
//  size of that at level i
//
//  Note that if set_uniform_reduction(false) and width of z pixels much more
//  than that in x and y,  then only smooth and sub-sample in x and y.
//  This is useful for images with non-isotropic sampling (eg MR images)
//  Similarly, if either x or y has significantly larger sample spacing,
//  the others will be smoothed first.  Note, currently only works for one
//  dimension being significantly larger than the other two.
