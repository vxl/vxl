// \brief Reader/Writer for v3i format images.
// \author Ian Scott - Manchester
// v3i is a VXL specific format designed to store all the information that
// can be stored in a vimt3d image. We don't recommend its use in general,
// having no wish to add to the plethora of badly designed image formats
// out there. However, a means of being able to save, and reload a full
// vil3d/vimt3d image using the standard vil3d_load_* API is very useful.
// The file format currently is that provided by the default vsl
// serialisation scheme. There is an extra v3i-specific magic number to
// avoid confusion with other vsl data files, and a version number to allow
// for a change in format.
//
// To use the v3i format with vil3d_load, vil3d_save, etc add
// the following code at the start of your program
// \verbatim
//  vil3d_file_format::add_format(new vimt3d_vil3d_v3i_format);
// \endverbatim
