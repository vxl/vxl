This package contains the Otago University public VXL library.
Current contents:

ouel: Otago University Estimation Library - currently only has a
linear Kalman filter.
oufgl: Otago University Frame Grabber Library - support for a pxc200 and 
should work for all video-for-linux devices on linux.
ouml: OU Misc Library - currently has an eigenfaces implementation,
and a simple polygon mesh implementation.

Warning: This code has not yet been tested using the current release of 
vxl as I've been unable to get that compiled correctly as yet. However,
it does compile under vxl-1.0-beta and should work with perhaps a few
minor mods under the latest vxl release.
