/*! \mainpage vpyr : The Topological Pyramid library.
* A set of classes to represent and manipulate pyramids of combinatorial/topological maps.
*
* \section intro Topological and Combinatorial Pyramids
*
* A topological 2-pyramid is a set of topological maps which can be deduced from one another by removing or contracting edges.
*
* vpyr_2_pyramid<TLevel> handle combinatorial pyramids. TLevel must inherit from vpyr_2_pyramid_level<D>, where D itself 
* must inherit from vpyr_2_pyramid_level_dart. Each level of the pyramid is handled exactly as vmap_2_map.
* The vpyr_2_pyramid uses implicit encoding. The structure is therefore linear in the number of edges of the base map.
*
* In order to access data attached to each dart, those have to be defined in an external struct.
* vmap_simple_data<S> can be used in order to replicate the data attached to darts on ll levels, whereas vmap_replicated_data<S>
* handles data of typ S which are replicated on all levels.
* A level vpyr_2_pyramid_level<D> can then be declared as:\verbatim

struct IdData // A simple structure handling data associated to all darts at all levels
{
  int id ;
} ;

struct my_pyramid_dart : public vmap_2_pdl_dart< vmap_simple_data<IdData> > // 
{
  int id() const
  {
    return data().id ;
  }

  int & id()
  {
    return data().id ;
  }
} ;

typedef vpyr_2_pyramid_level<my_pyramid_dart> my_pyramid_level ;
typedef vpyr_2_pyramid<my_pyramid_level> my_tpyramid ;
\endverbatim
* 
* vpyr_2_tpyramid works exactly the same way. Each level has to inherit from vpyr_2_tpyramid_level<V,E,F,D>.
* V,E,F and D themselves have to inherit from vpyr_2_tpyramid_level_vertex, vpyr_2_tpyramid_level_edge, 
* vpyr_2_tpyramid_level_face and vpyr_2_tpyramid_level_dart.
*
* down_projection_vertices (resp. down_projection_faces) functions may be used to retrieve the correspondance 
* between vertices (resp. the faces) of the base level and their ancestor at a higher level of the pyramid.
* This is needed, for example, when one wants to now which pixels (face of the grid) are included in a face 
* at a given level. Note that it is, from this function, possible to retrieve the correspondance between
* two arbitrary level. This functions are based on union/find startegies and are linear in the number of
* elements of the base map.
*
* vpyr_top_map and vpyr_top_tmap can be used in order to replicate the last level of a pyramid in an efficient bottom/up
* construction process. A simple segmentation process is illustrated in the example directory of vpyr.
