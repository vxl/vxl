/*! \mainpage rgrl : Rensselaer (Generalized) Registration Library
* The library is designed as a set of techniques to allow realization
* of a variety of correspondence-based registration algorithms.
*
* Components of the framework include initializers, feature sets,
* correspondence generators, robust transformation estimators, and
* convergence testers. Multiple feature types may be used either
* simultaneously or sequentially, and multiresolution is handled
* naturally.
*
* class rgrl_feature_based_registration
*  - the engine that represent the framework
*
* class rgrl_feature
*  - basic primitives of correspondence-based registration
*  - pre-computed or constructed dynamically
*
* class rgrl_feature_set
*  - a collection of features
*  - with representations suitable for spatial queries such as
*    finding the nearest neighbors
*
* class rgrl_initializer
*  - method to generate the initial transformation
*
* class rgrl_matcher
*  - generating correspondences from the two image feature sets.
*
* class rgrl_estimator
*  - estimating the spatial relationship that maps the moving image to
*    the fixed image using the matches
*  - transformation parameters stored in the rgrl_transformation of
*    the same model
*
* class rgrl_scale_estimator and rgrl_weighter
*  - for robust transformation estimation in the presence of
*    outliers/mis-matches
*
* class rgrl_convergence_tester
*  - testing whether the estimation has converged to a stable solution
*    or is oscillating.
