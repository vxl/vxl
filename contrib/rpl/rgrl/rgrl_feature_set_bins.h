//: A set of features grouped only by N-d location.
//
// This class is used to store a collection of discrete features for
// which proximity is determined only by location. There is no
// concepts of "segments"; each feature is considered independent.
//
// The class is templated over the dimension in order to provide
// efficient implementation of the queries.
//
// The underlying data structure is either rdsl_bins or
// rsdl_kd_tree. when using rsdl_bins, the image region is divided
// into rectangular bins, with the bin_size defaulted to 10 or defined
// by the user during construction. Feature point locations and
// associated values are stored in a list associated with the bin the
// location falls into. When performing region searches, all bins that
// intersect the query region are examined. When doing
// nearest-neighbor searches, spiral search is performed, starting at
// the bin containing the query point. rsdl_bins is the choice if the
// data is well distributed.
//
// rsdl_kd_tree is multi-dimensional version of binary search tree. It
// handles data clustering better than rsdl_bins. Example applications
// include range data registration.
