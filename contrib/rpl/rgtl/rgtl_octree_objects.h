//: Store a fixed set of objects in a spatial structure for efficient lookup.
//
// Given an array of objects with a few basic operations defined by
// rgtl_object_array, stores the objects in an efficient octree-based
// spatial structure.  The structure supports several spatial queries
// on the set of objects.  It features a distance transform that
// efficiently pre-computes distances from all octree leaf centers to
// their nearest object points.  This is used to significantly reduce
// the initial sphere radius for closest object queries.
