// Each subdivision level in an octree can be indexed as a regular
// grid of points of size 2^L+1 along each axis where L is the level
// of subdivision.  An octree corner point can be completely indexed
// by the level of subdivision and the regular grid index within that
// level.  The subdivision level index is a single integer.  The
// regular grid index within the subdivision level is a set of D
// integers.  Note that a point indexed at a given level has
// additional valid indices at higher levels of subdivision.
