//
//  Distance functions for rsdl points and bounding boxes.  These
//  points and bounding boxes have a mixture of cartesian and angular
//  coordinates, so the computation is a little more complicated than
//  ordinary Euclidean distance calculations.  Angles are treated in
//  a full 2*pi range, so that the maximum distance between two angles
//  is pi.  Also, bounding intervals on angles can be such that the
//  numerical value on the "min" angle is greater than the numerical
//  value on the "max" angle.  These are values that wrap-around 0.
//
//  Two assumptions are important.  First, it is assumed that all
//  angles are truly within a 2*pi range; it doesn't matter which.
//  This is an implementation (and efficiency) convenience.  Second,
//  any normalization for comparing angle and cartesian distance
//  measures has already been done.
