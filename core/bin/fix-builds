# To have a "shared libs" CMake config of vxl succeed, some library dependencies
# must be (temporarily) disabled; this can be done by editing the corresponding
# CMakeLists.txt files and removing some entries from TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES
# (** and then of course make sure not to check in those local changes! **)
# At the time of this writing (Feb.2011), the following cyclic dependencies are
# present and must thus be manually removed from the CMakeLists.txt files:
# From contrib/brl/bbas/bil/algo/CMakeLists.txt:      sdet
# From contrib/brl/bseg/boxm2/cpp/exe/CMakeLists.txt: sdet (2x)
# From contrib/brl/bseg/boxm2/tests/CMakeLists.txt:   sdet
# From contrib/brl/bseg/boxm2/ocl/CMakeLists.txt:     boxm2_ocl_pro
# From contrib/brl/bseg/boxm2/CMakeLists.txt:         boxm2_io
#
# To "fix" the thus generated files called link.txt in the CMake build directory,
# i.e., to add back the removed library dependencies into those link.txt files,
# run this script immediately after you ran the "cmake" command.
