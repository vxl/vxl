VXL - Documentation
-------------------

This directory holds documentation for the VXL libraries.  The documentation
comes in two main forms: automatically extracted source code comments and the
VXL book.

The VXL Book
************

The book (in subdirectory book) is a human-written collection of VXL
documentation.  It is written in texinfo, a limited form of LaTeX which allows
us to make various forms of output: printed, HTML, windows help files, emacs
info, and plain text files.  Each of these forms has its adherents, and each is
useful.

Automatically generated documentation
*************************************

An example of what the syntax for documentation looks like can be found
in vxl_doc_rules.[h,cxx]


To generate the entire documentation with doxygen
(http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen):

1. Look into Doxyfile and change the path to the source if needed
 (INPUT, EXCLUDE, STRIP_FROM_PATH)

2. You might want to switch on LATEX and MAN
 (GENERATE_LATEX = "YES", GENERATE_MAN = "YES")

3. Make sure doxygen is in your path

4. Type "doxygen Doxyfile"

To generate the documentation for the example vxl_doc_rules.[h,cxx]:

1. Make sure doxygen is in your path

2. Type "doxygen Doxyfile_for_vxl_doc_rules"
