@code{vgui} is a user interface library for computer vision applications
@code{vgui} supports the following general functions:
@itemize @bullet
@item Menus
@item Displaying Images
@item Displaying/Creating Geometric Features
@end itemize

The @code{vgui} design is based on the OpenGL graphics library, and is
intended to be platform independent and adaptable to a wide range of
GUI toolkits.  The central @code{vgui} class is the @code{tableau}
which is a region (or regions) of the screen for carrying out display
and event processing. Various tableaux can be assembled and layered to
create a complex gui application. At the same time, each tableau is
relatively simple and can often be used independently in a small
application such a popup image displayer.

This chapter is concerned with basic vgui programming and does not
consider the issues associated with adapting vgui to a new window system
and gui toolkit. The examples are demonstrated using the mfc implementation of
@code{vgui}.

@section A First Example
A simple example will be useful to illustrate some of the basics of vgui.
The appearance of an image displayer is shown in Figure 1.
@figure
@image{image-tableau-with-status,,3in}
@caption{1}
A @code{vgui} image display application.
@endcaption
@endfigure

The program, @code{basic01_display_image.cxx} that produced this
display is provided in the examples directory of the @code{vgui}
library, @code{vgui/examples/}. The code is reproduced below.
@example
@cartouche
#include <vcl_iostream.h>
#include <vgui/vgui.h>
#include <vgui/vgui_image_tableau.h>
#include <vgui/vgui_viewer2D_tableau.h>
#include <vgui/vgui_shell_tableau.h>
int main(int argc, char **argv)
@{
  vgui::init(argc, argv);
  if (argc <= 1)
  @{
    vcl_cerr << "Please give an image filename on the command line\n";
    return 0;
  @}

  // Load image (given in the first command line param)
  // into an image tableau.
  vgui_image_tableau_new image(argv[1]);

  // Put the image tableau inside a 2D viewer tableau (for zoom, etc).
  vgui_viewer2D_tableau_new viewer(image);

  // Put a shell tableau at the top of our tableau tree.
  vgui_shell_tableau_new shell(viewer);

  // Create a window, add the tableau and show it on screen.
  return vgui::run(shell, image->width(), image->height());
@}
@end cartouche
@end example

It will be useful to go through this example carefully since it brings
out some of the important characteristics of programming with tableaux.
@itemize
@item @code{vgui::init(argc, argv)}:
The class @code{vgui} is the base management class for the gui toolkits
and handles overall operations. In this example, the desired toolkit is
being potentially selected by arguments on the command line.  Normally,
the kit is not specified by the user but is the first element in a
registry of toolkits. For example, on windows, the mfc toolkit is
used by default. Currently @code{vgui} supports the following toolkits:
@itemize
@item OpenGL Utility Toolkit (GLUT) - http://www.xmission.com/~nate/opengl.html
@item Qt Toolkit - http://doc.trolltech.com
@item Gnu Toolkit (Gtk) - http://www.gtk.org
@item Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) - http://msdn.microsoft.com/library
@end itemize

@item @code{vgui_image_tableau_new image(argv[1])}:
The @code{vgui_image_tableau} is a very basic tableau that mainly handles the
display of pixels on the screen and can provide properties of the image
being displayed.  We see a somewhat strange construction in the term
@code{vgui_image_tableau_new}.  The idea is that all the tableaux
support smart pointers (see vbl/vbl_smart_ptr.h). However it is
desirable to be able to cast up and down the tableaux class
hierarchies. The machinery needed to do this is maintained by the
@code{xxx_new} form of construction, rather than calling the tableau
constructor directly. This mechanism will be discussed later in the
context of building a new sub-tableau.

An equivalent, and perhaps clearer, form is:
@example
vgui_image_tableau_sptr image = vgui_image_tableau_new(argv[1]);
@end example
The constructor reads the image file specified by
@code{argv[1]} and then inserts it into the image tableau, image.

If an image is already available, then the construction can be
carried out as follows:
@example
vil_image img;
... // get the image somehow
vgui_image_tableau_sptr image = vgui_image_tableau_new(img);
@end example

If the @code{image_tableau} already exists, then one can change the image
being displayed:
@example
vil_image img1, img2;
... //get the images somehow
//construct the image_tableau with img1
vgui_image_tableau_sptr image = vgui_image_tableau_new(img1);
//change the image to img2.
image->set_image(img2);
@end example

@item @code{vgui_viewer2D_tableau_new viewer(image)}:
Next, the @code{vgui_image_tableau}, @code{image}, is added to a
@code{vgui_viewer2D_tableau}.  The viewer is responsible for
manipulating the pan and zoom states of the tableaux being viewed,
i.e, those @emph{below} the viewer in the tableaux hierarchy.  In our
simple example, only the image tableau is under the control of the
viewer.  Again, an alternative form for the construction is:
@example
vgui_viewer2D_tableau_sptr viewer = vgui_viewer2D_tableau_new(image);
@end example
The viewer responds to a variety of events such as key presses, mouse
motion and mouse clicks. See @ref{events}. The current implementation has the following
menu of event processing:
@multitable @columnfractions 0.5 0.5
@item (CTRL + left mouse) @tab @code{zoom in}
@item (CTRL + middle mouse)@tab @code{pan}
@item (CTRL + right mouse) @tab @code{zoom out}
@item (CTRL + 'c') @tab @code{center}
@item (CTRL + 'x') @tab @code{resize}
@item (CTRL + '-') @tab @code{lower zoom factor}
@item (CTRL + '=') @tab @code{raise zoom factor}
@item ('n') @tab @code{toggle aliasing}
@item ('z') @tab @code{toggle zoom type}
@item ('d') @tab @code{sweep zoom}
@end multitable

Run the @code{basic01_display_image} example and try the various event
actions. Note that, on windows, a middle mouse is often hard to come
by since the middle mouse button does not produce a middle mouse button
event by default on Windows.  If you are not getting middle mouse button
events then look at Start->Settings->Control Panel->Mouse.  Check on
the "Button Actions" tab that your middle mouse button is set to "Middle"
Alternatively, the use of scroll bars can substitute for panning by
middle botton mouse movement.

@item @code{vgui_shell_tableau_new shell(viewer)}:
The shell tableau is a composite of three tableaux, including the
viewer tableau just described.  The second tableau is called
@code{vgui_clear_tableau} and clears the display area on each draw
operation. Without this clear function, the image display will include
old renderings of the image in the background.

The third tableau is a @code{vgui_tview_launcher_tableau} which
prepares and displays a graph illustrating the tableau layout. This
graph can be displayed using the 'G' key-press event. The tableau
graph for this example is shown in Figure 2.  Extra annotations have
been added for illustration.  This graph is useful for debugging
complex tableau configurations. If the mouse is clicked above a node in
the graph, information about the tableau will be streamed to vcl_cout.

@figure
@image{tableau-hierarchy-annotated,,3in}
@caption{2}
The nested tableaux form a tree structure.  This structure can be displayed by
the @code{vgui_tview_launcher_tableau} which is part of the composite
@code{vgui_shell_tableau}. The edges in the graph are represented by instances
of the class @code{vgui_parent_child_link}.
@endcaption
@endfigure

@item @code{vgui::run(shell, image->width(), image->height())}:
This last expression causes the shell tableau hierarchy to be
displayed on the screen and to continuously process events.  The
window size is determined by the last two arguments.  Note that
the borders of the window are included in these values so, for
small images, the margin widths can be significant and the entire image
is not visible when the window is displayed.
@end itemize

In programming with tableaux, it is often necessary to retrieve a
particular tableau in a hierarchy such as the shell @expansion{} viewer
@expansion{} image stack in the example. This access is provided by the method,
@code{vgui_tableau_sptr::vertical_cast(vgui_tableau_sptr const& tab)}.
The following code fragment will illustrate its use:
@example
vgui_image_tableau_sptr get_image_tab(vgui_tableau_sptr const& tab)
@{
  vgui_image_tableau_sptr i_tab;
  if (tab)
    itab.vertical_cast(vgui_find_below_by_type_name(tab,
                       vcl_string("vgui_image_tableau")));
  return i_tab;
@}
@end example
If the input tableau, @code{tab}, is above an image tableau in the
hierarchy then this routine will return it, otherwise the returned
tableau will be null. One can also keep smart pointers to each tableau
as members in an application class, which provides convenient access.


@section Tableaux des Tableaux
@subsection The Grid
In many computer vision applications, it is useful to be able to display
multiple images in the same window.  The @code{vgui_grid_tableau} is
designed for this purpose.  The each element of the grid holds a sub-hierarchy
of tableaux.
A simple example of multiple panes is provided by
@code{vgui/examples/basic01a_multiple_panes.cxx}, reproduced below.
The result of executing this program with two image paths supplied
on the command line is shown in Figure 3.
@example
@cartouche
#include <vcl_iostream.h>
#include <vgui/vgui.h>
#include <vgui/vgui_image_tableau.h>
#include <vgui/vgui_viewer2D_tableau.h>
#include <vgui/vgui_shell_tableau.h>
#include <vgui/vgui_grid_tableau.h>
int main(int argc, char **argv)
@{
  vgui::init(argc, argv);
  if (argc <= 2)
  @{
    vcl_cerr << "Please give two image filenames on the command line\n";
    return 0;
  @}
  // Load two images(given in the first two command line args)
  // and construct separate image tableaux
  vgui_image_tableau_new image_tab1(argv[1]);
  vgui_image_tableau_new image_tab2(argv[2]);

  //Put the image tableaux into viewers
  vgui_viewer2D_tableau_new viewer1(image_tab1);
  vgui_viewer2D_tableau_new viewer2(image_tab2);

  //Put the viewers into a grid
  vgui_grid_tableau_sptr grid = new vgui_grid_tableau(2,1);
  grid->add_at(viewer1, 0,0);
  grid->add_at(viewer2, 1,0);
  // Put the grid into a shell tableau at the top the hierarchy
  vgui_shell_tableau_new shell(grid);

  // Create a window, add the tableau and show it on screen.
  int width = image_tab1->width() + image_tab2->width();
  int height = image_tab1->height() + image_tab2->height();
  return vgui::run(shell, width, height);
@}
@end cartouche
@end example
@figure
@image{multiple-panes,,2.5in}
@caption{3}
The @code{vgui_grid_tableau} supports the display of multiple panes.
@endcaption
@endfigure
The use of tableaux is very similar to the first example, except that two
image tableaux and two viewer2D tableaux are constructed. A 2x1
@code{vgui_vgrid_tableau} is constructed and the viewers are inserted in the
left and right panes. Note that the order of the indices in the method,
@code{vgui_grid_tableau::add_at(unsigned col, unsigned row)} is transposed from
the order normally used for matrices, i.e. rows then columns.
constructed.

In the case of multiple panes, it becomes an issue as to which pane is
considered active.  That is, suppose we wanted to replace the image in a pane
selected by the user. How does the user indicate what pane is to be updated?
A simple approach would be to have the user input the column and row of the
grid cell to be updated using a menu (we will discuss menus in a later section).
There are several additional grid methods that help define the grid cell that
is to be operated on.
@itemize
@item @code{void get_active_position(unsigned* col_pos,unsigned* row_pos)}:
This method returns the column and row of the cell which is under the mouse cursor.
@item @code{void get_last_selected_position(unsigned* col_pos,unsigned* row_pos)}:
This method returns the column and row of the last cell where the left mouse key was clicked.
@end itemize
An application can then use these selections to operate on the desired pane.
For example, if a user wants to load and image from a file into a particular
pane, they would click on the desired pane and then push the load-image menu.
The menu callback routine would use the last_selected_position method to
identify the appropriate @code{vgui_image_tableau}.
@subsection The Deck
@figure
@image{deck-tableau,,3in}
@caption{4}
The @code{vgui_deck_tableau} supports the display of a stack of child tableaux.
A typical application is to be able to page through a sequence of images.
Only the tableau root on the top of the stack responds to events, such as pan and zoom.
@endcaption
@endfigure
Another useful capability is to stack displays in a pane.  Then the application
can ``page'' through the displays.  Only the tableau hierarchy on the ``top''
of the deck responds to events, such as zooming and panning controls.  The
creation of a deck is illustrated by the example,
@code{vgui/examples/basic01b_deck.cxx}.  The concept of a deck is shown in Figure 4.
The example code is:
@example
@cartouche
#include <vcl_iostream.h>
#include <vnl/vnl_math.h>
#include <vgui/vgui.h>
#include <vgui/vgui_image_tableau.h>
#include <vgui/vgui_viewer2D_tableau.h>
#include <vgui/vgui_shell_tableau.h>
#include <vgui/vgui_deck_tableau.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv)
@{
  vgui::init(argc, argv);
  if (argc <= 2)
  @{
    vcl_cerr << "Please give two image filenames on the command line\n";
    return 0;
  @}
  // Load two images(given in the first two command line args)
  // and construct separate image tableaux
  vgui_image_tableau_new image_tab1(argv[1]);
  vgui_image_tableau_new image_tab2(argv[2]);

  //Put the image tableaux into a deck
  vgui_deck_tableau_sptr deck = vgui_deck_tableau_new();
  deck->add(image_tab1);
  deck->add(image_tab2);

  vgui_viewer2D_tableau_new viewer(deck);

  // Put the deck into a shell tableau at the top the hierarchy
  vgui_shell_tableau_new shell(viewer);

  // Create a window, add the tableau and show it on screen.
  int width = vnl_math_max(image_tab1->width(), image_tab2->width());
  int height = vnl_math_max(image_tab1->height(), image_tab2->height());

  //Add 50 to account for window borders
  return vgui::run(shell, width+50, height+50);
@}
@end cartouche
@end example
The deck tableau responds to @code{vgui_PAGE_UP} and @code{vgui_PAGE_DOWN}
events, which advance or backup the deck sequence.
@section Displaying Geometry
@subsection Displaying 2-d Features
@figure
@image{display-2d-annotated,,3in}
@caption{5}
Geometry overlayed an the image is shown on the right.  The tableau graph for this example is shown on the left.
@endcaption
@endfigure
@anchor{easy2D}
@code{vgui} supports the @emph{subject-view} programming pattern.  That
is, there is a clear separation between a class object, such as a line
segment, and its @emph{view} which is the manner in which it is
rendered on the screen. Indeed, one can have many different views for
a given object. The same line can be displayed with
different line widths or colors, or even in an entirely different form
such as a point in an image of Hough space, (rho, theta).
Note, this subject-view approach is perversely called document-view in MFC.

The following example illustrates the ability of vgui to display
geometric figures, and its result is shown in Figure 5.
@example
@cartouche
#include <vcl_iostream.h>
#include <vgui/vgui.h>
#include <vgui/vgui_image_tableau.h>
#include <vgui/vgui_easy2D_tableau.h>
#include <vgui/vgui_viewer2D_tableau.h>
#include <vgui/vgui_shell_tableau.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv)
@{
  vgui::init(argc, argv);
  if (argc <= 1)
  @{
    vcl_cerr << "Please give an image filename on the command line\n";
    return 0;
  @}

  // Load an image into an image.tableau
  vgui_image_tableau_new image(argv[1]);

  // Put the image.tableau into a easy2D tableau
  vgui_easy2D_tableau_new easy2D(image);

  // Add a point, line, and infinite line
  easy2D->set_foreground(0,1,0);
  easy2D->set_point_radius(5);
  easy2D->add_point(10, 20);

  easy2D->set_foreground(0,0,1);
  easy2D->set_line_width(2);
  easy2D->add_line(100,100,200,400);

  easy2D->set_foreground(0,1,0);
  easy2D->set_line_width(2);
  easy2D->add_infinite_line(1,1,-100);

  // Put the easy2D tableau into a viewer2D tableau:
  vgui_viewer2D_tableau_new viewer(easy2D);
  vgui_shell_tableau_new shell(viewer);

  // Create a window, add the tableau and show it on screen:
  return vgui::run(shell, image->width(), image->height());
@}
@end cartouche
@end example
The first new code we encounter in the example is:
@example
  vgui_easy2D_tableau_new easy2D(image);
@end example
or equivalently,
@example
  vgui_easy2D_tableau_sptr easy2D = vgui_easy2D_tableau_new(image);
@end example

The @code{vgui_easy2D_tableau} is responsible for rendering 2-d
geometric shapes on top of its child, a @code{vgui_image_tableau}.
The commands for inserting various geometric elements are of the form
@code{add_xxx(...)}.  @code{vgui_easy2D_tableau} assumes an
elemental form of geometric specification, where the points and lines
are directly specified by their parameters. The defintions for each add
method used in the example are:

@example
vgui_soview2D_point* add_point(float x, float y)
vgui_soview2D_lineseg* add_line(float x0, float y0, float x1, float y1)
vgui_soview2D_infinite_line* add_infinite_line(float a, float b, float c)
@end example

The point is defined by its location.  The line segment is specified by the endpoints.
The infinite line is specified by its line coefficients:
@ @ @ @ @ @ ax + by +c = 0.

The appearance (or @emph{style}) of the display is controlled by the following style specifiers:
@example
void set_foreground(float r, float g, float b)
void set_line_width(float w)
void set_point_radius(float r)
@end example

The term @emph{foreground} refers to the color of the displayed
geometry. The style of each element added to @code{vgui_easy2D} after
the @code{set_foreground}, @code{set_line_width}, and @code{set_point_radius}
commands is assigned according to their specification until a new style command is issued.

@figure
@image{soview-hierarchy,,3in}
@caption{6}
The hierarchy for 2-d soviews. @code{vgui} also has some support for 3-d rendering.
@endcaption
@endfigure

A particular view of a geometric entity is specified by the class,
@code{vgui_soview} which has the hierarchy shown in Figure 6. The
constructor for a @code{vgui_soview} extracts the necessary
information from the object to specify OpenGL redering commands.  The
commands then add to the OpenGL display list to be rendered. While the
current set is adequate for a wide range of computer vision programming,
more advanced users will want to create their own @code{vgui_soview}
subclass to provide convenient display interfaces for their objects, or to
achieve special viewing capabilities.
@subsection Interactive Drawing of 2-d Features
It is often necessary to create geometric features such as a box to
define a region of interest for image processing or a line for sampling
pixels to provide an intensity plot. The following example shows how to
create an interactive tool for drawing lines and circles. Interactive drawing
consists of a tight loop of mouse position tracking and rendering so
that the feature point tracks the mouse movements. This loop is called
rubber-banding, since the feature seems to stretch and pull as the
mouse moves. The rubberband loop is usually terminated by an event,
such as a left mouse click.  An example of a rubberband application is
provided in @code{vgui/examples/basic10a_rubberband.cxx}. For this
example, a left mouse click starts rubber-banding the feature and
another left click terminates the rubber-banding and inserts the
feature into the @code{vgui_easy2D_tableau}.
@example
@cartouche
#include <vcl_iostream.h>
#include <vgui/vgui.h>
#include <vgui/vgui_menu.h>
#include <vgui/vgui_image_tableau.h>
#include <vgui/vgui_easy2D_tableau.h>
#include <vgui/vgui_rubberband_tableau.h>
#include <vgui/vgui_viewer2D_tableau.h>
#include <vgui/vgui_shell_tableau.h>

//global pointer to the rubberband tableau
static vgui_rubberband_tableau_sptr rubber = 0;

//the meunu callback functions
static void create_line()
@{
  rubber->rubberband_line();
@}
static void create_circle()
@{
  rubber->rubberband_circle();
@}

// Create the edit menu
vgui_menu create_menus()
@{
  vgui_menu edit;
  edit.add("CreateLine",create_line,(vgui_key)'l',vgui_CTRL);
  edit.add("CreateCircle",create_circle,(vgui_key)'k',vgui_CTRL);
  vgui_menu bar;
  bar.add("Edit",edit);
  return bar;
@}

int main(int argc, char ** argv)
@{
  vgui::init(argc,argv);
  if (argc <= 1)
  @{
    vcl_cerr << "Please give an image filename on the command line\n";
    return 0;
  @}
  // Make the tableau hierarchy.
  vgui_image_tableau_new image(argv[1]);
  vgui_easy2D_tableau_new easy(image);
  vgui_rubberband_easy2D_client* r_client =
    new vgui_rubberband_easy2D_client(easy);
  rubber = vgui_rubberband_tableau_new(r_client);
  vgui_composite_tableau_new comp(easy, rubber);
  vgui_viewer2D_tableau_new viewer(comp);
  vgui_shell_tableau_new shell(viewer);

  // Create and run the window
  return vgui::run(shell, 512, 512, create_menus());
@}
@end cartouche
@end example
This example introduces several new coding aspects to discuss.
@itemize
@item @code{vgui_rubberband_tableau_new(new vgui_rubberband_easy2D_client(easy))}:
The tight loop between mouse tracking and drawing requires a means for rendering
the feature as its parameters are continuously adjusted by the mouse. The
application could use OpenGL commands directly, but it is much simpler to use
the drawing commands provided by the @code{vgui_easy2D_tableau} that was
decribed earlier. See @ref{easy2D}.

In order to link the rubberbanding and the drawing it is necessary to
specify a class called the @code{vgui_rubber_band_client}. The client is
assumed to be capable of drawing all the shapes that can be rubberbanded by
the rubberband tableau.  A sub-class called @code{vgui_rubberband_easy2D_client}
is defined in the @code{vgui_rubberband_tableau.h} header file and handles all
the currently rubberbandable shapes.
@item @code{vgui_composite_tableau_new comp(easy, rubber)}:
The rubberband tableau and its drawing client are included together in a
composite tableau which forms the complete rubberband drawing capability.
@end itemize
@subsection Rendering 3-d Features
The 3-d display capabilities in vgui are not well-developed.
Currently one can only display 3-d points and lines. The 3-d viewer
does provide a ``trackball'' mode of interaction in viewing the 3-d
geometry. An example of the @code{vgui} 3-d display is shown in Figure
7.
@figure
@image{threeD-example,,3in}
@caption{7}
vgui's 3-d display.
@endcaption
@endfigure
@section Menus
@subsection Basic Menus
@code{vgui} supports basic menu capabilites such as menu bars and popup menus
as illustrated in the following example, @code{vgui/examples/basic05_menubar.cxx}:
@example
@cartouche
#include <vcl_iostream.h>
#include <vgui/vgui.h>
#include <vgui/vgui_menu.h>
#include <vgui/vgui_image_tableau.h>
#include <vgui/vgui_viewer2D_tableau.h>
#include <vgui/vgui_shell_tableau.h>

// Set up a dummy callback function for the menu to call (for
// simplicity all menu items will call this function):
static void dummy()
@{
  vcl_cerr << "Dummy function called\n";
@}

// Create a vgui menu:
vgui_menu create_menus()
@{
  vgui_menu file;
  file.add("Open",dummy,(vgui_key)'O',vgui_CTRL);
  file.add("Quit",dummy,(vgui_key)'R',vgui_SHIFT);

  vgui_menu image;
  image.add("Center image",dummy);
  image.add("Show histogram",dummy);

  vgui_menu bar;
  bar.add("File",file);
  bar.add("Image",image);

  return bar;
@}

int main(int argc, char ** argv)
@{
  vgui::init(argc,argv);
  if (argc <= 1)
 @{
    vcl_cerr << "Please give an image filename on the command line\n";
    return 0;
 @}

  // Make our tableau hierarchy.
  vgui_image_tableau_new image(argv[1]);
  vgui_viewer2D_tableau_new viewer(image);
  vgui_shell_tableau_new shell(viewer);

  // Create a window, but this time we also pass in a vgui_menu.
  return vgui::run(shell, 512, 512, create_menus());
@}
@end cartouche
@end example
The appearance of this program is shown in Figure 8.
@figure
@image{menu-example,,3in}
@caption{8}
A @code{vgui} example involving menus.  The menu bar on the top has sub-menus
as indicated in the figure. In the example, all the menu choices call the same
dummy function.
@endcaption
@endfigure

By now, most of this code should follow a familiar pattern. The new
element is the function @code{vgui_menu create_menus()}. The menu
structure is assembled hierarchically where the top-level menus have
sub-menus which can have, sub-menus etc. The basic menu construction pattern
is illustrated by the line:
@example
  file.add("Open",dummy,(vgui_key)'O',vgui_CTRL);
@end example

The first argument @code{"Open"} is a string representing the
label of the menu item in the menu. The second argument is the
name of the function to be called when the menu is selected.  The last
two arguments define a key-press configuration that will select the
menu item without clicking on it with the mouse. In this case, the
function @code{dummy()} is called by pressing the key combination,
@code{CTRL + 'o'}.
@subsection Pop-up Menus
The appearance of a @code{vgui} pop-up menu is shown in Figure 9.  A pop-up
menu is launched by pressing the right mouse button over the active application
window. Typically the role of the pop-up menu is to present operations that are
relevant to the context present when the right button is pressed.  For example,
if we are displaying an image, there would be image display or image processing
operations presented in the menu.  Another mode might dominate when the tableau
contains only geometric features. In that case, the menu items might present
geometric operations such as translation or rotation.

@}
@end cartouche
@end example
This example contains a few new elements that should be discussed.
@itemize
@item @code{vgui_window *win = vgui::produce_window(512, 512)}:
In this case the widow is created before the display is launched. In
the previous examples, the window was created at the time of launch
using the @code{vgui::run(..)} command.  Here the window is initialized
to size 512x512 display resolution elements.

@item @code{win->get_adaptor()->include_in_popup(create_menus())}:
This line introduces the class, @code{vgui_adaptor}.  The idea of the
adaptor is to provide a uniform interface for events across all
toolkits. The adaptor also dispatches draw requests to the tableau
hierarchy. A key role for the adaptor is to attach itself to a tableau
using the method, @code{vgui_adaptor::set_tableau}.  Then events
received by the adaptor can then be passed down the tableau
hierarchy. In the example, the @code{vgui_shell_tableau} is the root
of the tableau hierarchy, and the adaptor is attached to the shell.

Each tableau in the hierarchy can add to the pop-up menu. In this
example the specified menu is being included at the top-most level,
i.e. the adaptor. It is also possible to define pop-up menu entries in each
tableau in the hierarchy. To see an example of adding items to the pop-up
menu by a tableau lower in the hierarchy, take a look at
@code{vgui_clear_tableau::add_popup(..)}.

@item @code{win->get_adaptor()->bind_popups()}:
This command binds the appropriate button and modifier to launch the
pop-up menu. This method depends on the particular toolkit and is
defined by the adaptor sub-class in the @code{vgui/impl/} sub-directory for
the toolkit being invoked.

@item @code{win->show()}:
This code causes the window to be exposed on the screen.

@item @code{vgui::run()}:
This command tells the window to process all events until it is terminated.
Unlike the previous examples, the window has been constructed in
advance of the run command.

@section Dialog Menus
It is often necessary to obtain values for parameters, such as edge
detection thresholds or scales before applying the operation to an
image. Also it is frequently necessary to obtain a file path string in
order to read data such as image. These functions are satisfied by the
@emph{dialog menu}. An example of a dialog is shown in Figure 10, which
corresponds to @code{vgui/examples/basic07_dialog.cxx}.
@figure
@image{dialog-example,,4in}
@caption{10}
The dialog menu appears when a menu item is pressed that calls a function
containing a dialog.  The dialog displays names and values as well as boolean
check boxes. The state of the boxes and values can be changed and when the
dialog is dispatched, the altered values are bound to the variables in the
dialog specification. In this simple example, the latest values are output
to @code{vcl_cerr}.
@endcaption
@endfigure
The following example illustrates these points.

@end cartouche
@end example
A dialog pops up when the associated menu item is selected. The dialog interface
is reasonably self-explanitory, but it will be useful to discuss some of the main elements.
@itemize
@item @code{static int choice_value = 1}:
It is desirable to have the values in the dialog persist from one
invocation to the next. This persistence is enabled through the use of
static variables.  Also note that the indexing of the choices starts
at 1, i.e., ``fltk'' is the first element of the choice list. The
appearance of the choice sub dialog is shown in Figure 11 a).
@item @code{mydialog.inline_file("file browser", regexp, file_value)}:
This file browser dialog element is used extensively in applications.
The interface is:
@code{void inline_file(const char* label,vcl_string& regexp,vcl_string& filepath)}

The argument @code{label} is the displayed name of the dialog slot
attached to the file browser. The string @code{regexp} defines a
filter on the file extensions so that only a class of files will
appear in the browser. For example, if only jpeg images are to
be selected the argument assignment would be, @code{static vcl_string
regexp = "*.jpg"}.  The third argument is the result and returns
the path to the selected file.

@item @code{if (mydialog.ask())}:
This function pops up the dialog and waits for the @code{ok} or
@code{cancel} button to be pushed. If @code{ok} is pushed then the
function returns @emph{true}, and the dialog values can be processed
by the users application.

@item @code{mydialog.inline_tableau(viewer, 512, 512)}:
Dialogs can contain an embedded hierarchy of tableaux. In this example
an image viewer with pan and zoom capability is included in the
dialog as shown in Figure 12.  Any tableau can be inserted, such as
@code{vgui_easy2D_tableau}, and its capability could be used to
display geometric objects.
@end itemize

@section Event Processing
@anchor{events}
As applications become more sophisticated, the programmer will need to be able
to process events in a manner appropriate to customized interactive tasks.
The @code{vgui} design has a simple interface for handling events as is
illustrated by @code{vgu/examples/basic09_mouse_position}.
The code for this example:
@example
@cartouche
#include <vcl_iostream.h>
#include <vgui/vgui.h>
#include <vgui/vgui_image_tableau.h>
#include <vgui/vgui_viewer2D_tableau.h>
#include <vgui/vgui_shell_tableau.h>
//------------------------------------------------------------
// A tableau that displays the mouse position
// when left mouse button is pressed.
struct example_tableau : public vgui_image_tableau
@{
  example_tableau(char const *f) : vgui_image_tableau(f)@{ @}

  ~example_tableau() @{ @}

  bool handle(const vgui_event &e)
  @{
    if (e.type == vgui_BUTTON_DOWN &&
        e.button == vgui_LEFT && e.modifier == 0)
    @{
      vcl_cout << "selecting at " << e.wx << ' ' << e.wy << vcl_endl;
      return true; // event has been used
    @}

    //  We are not interested in other events,
    //  so pass event to base class:
    return vgui_image_tableau::handle(e);
  @}
@};
//-------------------------------------------------------------
// Make a smart-pointer constructor for our tableau.
struct example_tableau_new : public vgui_image_tableau_sptr
@{
  example_tableau_new(char const *f) : vgui_image_tableau_sptr(
    new example_tableau(f)) @{ @}
@};
@end cartouche
@end example
@example
@cartouche
//-------------------------------------------------------------
//The first command line argument is expected
// to be an image filename.
int main(int argc,char **argv)
@{
  vgui::init(argc, argv);
  if (argc <= 1)
  @{
    vcl_cerr << "Please give an image filename\n";
    return 0;
  @}

  // Load an image into my tableau
  // (derived from vgui_image_tableau)
  vgui_tableau_sptr my_tab = example_tableau_new(argv[1]);

  vgui_viewer2D_tableau_new viewer(my_tab);
  vgui_shell_tableau_new shell(viewer);

  // Start event loop, using easy method.
  return vgui::run(shell, 512, 512);
@}
@end cartouche
@end example
This example contains a number of new concepts that are important to
building custom applications. The example illustrates how to go about
creating a new tableau, which is a subclass of an existing tableau.
@itemize
@item @code{struct example_tableau : public vgui_image_tableau}:
The new tableau is a child of the @code{vgui_imge_tableau}. The tableau is
being defined as a @code{struct}, however it could also be a class.

@item @code{struct example_tableau_new : public vgui_image_tableau_sptr}:
VXL makes use of smart pointers extensively to prevent memory leaks.
The smart pointer maintains a reference count so that an object (or
struct) can be deleted when the reference count goes to zero, i.e., no
one is referencing a pointer to the object. A drawback to the smart pointer
approach is that inheritance is not maintained, that is, the smart pointer of a
child of a class is not a sub-class of the smart pointer of the class.
@code{vgui} has implemented a solution to this problem by creating a
hierarchy of smart pointers that match the tableau hierarchy.

@item @code{bool handle(const vgui_event &e)}:
The base class for all tableaux, @code{vgui_tableau} defines the
virtual method, @emph{handle}, which is called as events are passed
down the tableau hierarchy. The event is initially captured by the
@code{vgu_adaptor} which then passes it to its base tableau. If there
is no handle method defined for a tableau, then the event is processed
by its parents.

@item @code{return vgui_image_tableau::handle(e)}:
After a particular handle method has processed an event it, can mark
it as used (@emph{true}) or unused (@emph{false}). If an event is
considered used by a tableau then it is eliminated and not presented
to any other tableau.  If the event is unused, then it is further dispatched
to child tableaux or returned to the parent.

@item @code{if (e.type == vgui_BUTTON_DOWN..)}:
@code{vgui} represents a spectrum of event types, which are summarized at this point for convenient reference.
@end itemize

It is often required to include the definition of a tableau smart
pointer in other class implementations. When a new tableau is created
it is convenient to define the smart pointer in a
@samp{xxx_tableau_sptr.h} file as follows:

@example
#include <vgui/vgui_tableau_sptr.h>

class xxx_tableau;
typedef vgui_tableau_sptr_t<xxx_tableau> xxx_tableau_sptr;
@end example


@subsection @code{vgui} Events
The general types of events handled by @code{vgui} are:
@itemize @bullet
@item drawing
@item mouse button down
@item mouse button up
@item mouse motion
@item key press (and key modifiers)
@item timers
@end itemize
The following is a partial list of the event enum symbols defined in
@code{vgui_event.h}. Not all of the events enumerated in
@code{vgui_event} are described here. Some of them seem to be
vestigial and not exploited in code. A few comments will be added where
the event function is not obvious.
@itemize
@item @code{vgui_BUTTON_DOWN=vgui_MOUSE_DOWN=vgui_MOUSE_PRESS}
@item @code{vgui_BUTTON_UP=vgui_MOUSE_UP=vgui_MOUSE_RELEASE}
@item @code{vgui_DRAW}, @code{vgui_DRAW_OVERLAY} and @code{vgui_RESHAPE}
These events cause the OpenGL display list to be re-rendered.  The
draw events are generated by the virtual tableau methods,
@code{vgui_tableau::post_redraw()} and
@code{vgui_tableau::post_overlay_redraw()}. When a tableau creates or
modifies some displayable features, it is necessary to post the redraw
event to stimulate the OpenGL display list to be re-rendered.  At
present, the use of overlay_redraw events is not extensive in
@code{vgui}.  The design idea was that one may not want to redraw the entire
display list. In the current implementation, all these events are treated
by redrawing the display list.
@item @code{vgui_ENTER} and @code{vgui_LEAVE}
These events are triggered when the mouse enters/leaves the window.
@item @code{vgui_HSCROLL} and @code{vgui_VSCROLL}
When a window has specified the addition of scroll bars,
these events are emitted when the scroll bars are moved.
@item @code{vgui_KEY_PRESS=vgui_KEY_DOWN}
@item @code{vgui_KEY_RELEASE=vgui_KEY_UP}
@item @code{vgui_MOTION}
This event occurs whenever the mouse is in motion over the window.
@item @code{vgui_TIMER}
@code{vgui} allows users to set a timer and then have an event issued when
the time interval is completed. The timer is set by the
@code{vgui_adaptor::post_timer(..)} method. For example, the code
@code{e.origin->post_timer(100.0)} retrieves the @code{vgui_adaptor} and
issues a timer post of 100 milliseconds.
@item @code{vgui_DESTROY}
This event is caused by issuing a vgui_adaptor::post_destroy() command.
The purpose is to allow exit processing to be carried out before the application quits.
@end itemize
@subsection @code{vgui} Buttons, Keys and Modifiers
The following table defines the @code{vgui} enum symbols for buttons, keys
and modifers:

@multitable @columnfractions 0.5 0.5
@item ===== Buttons ===== @tab @
@item @code{vgui_LEFT} @tab left mouse button
@item @code{vgui_MIDDLE} @tab middle mouse button
@item @code{vgui_RIGHT} @tab right mouse button
@item ===== Keys ===== @tab @
@item @code{vgui_ESC} @tab ascii 27
@item @code{vgui_TAB} @tab @samp{\t}
@item @code{vgui_RETURN} @tab @samp{\r}
@item @code{vgui_NEWLINE} @tab @samp{\n}
@item @code{vgui_F1 } @tab 0x100 + 1
@item @code{vgui_F2 } @tab 0x100 + 2
@item @code{vgui_F3 } @tab 0x100 + 3
@item @code{vgui_F4 } @tab 0x100 + 4
@item @code{vgui_F5 } @tab 0x100 + 5
@item @code{vgui_F6 } @tab 0x100 + 6
@item @code{vgui_F7 } @tab 0x100 + 7
@item @code{vgui_F9 } @tab 0x100 + 8
@item @code{vgui_F10 } @tab 0x100 + 9
@item @code{vgui_F11 } @tab 0x100 + 10
@item @code{vgui_F12 } @tab 0x100 + 11
@item @code{vgui_CURSOR_LEFT } @tab 0x100 + 12
@item @code{vgui_CURSOR_UP } @tab 0x100 + 13
@item @code{vgui_CURSOR_RIGHT } @tab 0x100 + 14
@item @code{vgui_CURSOR_DOWN } @tab 0x100 + 15
@item @code{vgui_PAGE_UP } @tab 0x100 + 16
@item @code{vgui_PAGE_DOWN } @tab 0x100 + 17
@item @code{vgui_HOME } @tab 0x100 + 18
@item @code{vgui_END } @tab 0x100 + 19
@item @code{vgui_DELETE } @tab 0x100 + 20
@item @code{vgui_INSERT } @tab 0x100 + 21
@item ===== Modifiers ===== @tab @
@item @code{vgui_NULL} @tab 0x0
@item @code{vgui_CTRL} @tab 0x1
@item @code{vgui_SHIFT} @tab 0x2
@item @code{vgui_META} @tab 0x4
@item @code{vgui_ALT} @tab 0x8
@end multitable

When a key press event is dispatched it carries information that
specifies the key and modifier structure. This code fragment
illustrates the use of modified keys:
@example
bool handle(vgui_event const & e)
@{
  vgui_key k = e.key;
  vgui_modifier m = e.modifier;
  if (m & vgui_CTRL)
    if (k == 's')
     @{
      // Do something appropriate for CTRL + 's'
      ...
     @}
  return true;
@}
@end example
The bit corresponding to the modifer is tested to see if further
action switched by the actual key is warranted.  Note that the key in
a @code{vgui_event} is always lower case. This eliminates the
ambiguity that might arise in the use of the SHIFT key and upper case
vs lower case characters.  The following table will illustrate the
effect of various modifier combinations.

@multitable @columnfractions 0.25 0.25 0.25 0.25
@item key press @tab modifier @tab key @tab ascii character
@item ======= @tab ======= @tab ======= @tab =======
@item @code{a} @tab @code{vgui_NULL} @tab @samp{a} @tab @samp{a}
@item @code{CTRL+a} @tab @code{vgui_CTRL} @tab @samp{a} @tab @samp{^a}
@item @code{SHIFT+a} @tab @code{vgui_SHIFT} @tab @samp{a} @tab @samp{A}
@item @code{/} @tab @code{vgui_NULL} @tab @samp{/} @tab @samp{/}
@item @code{?} @tab @code{vgui_SHIFT} @tab @samp{/} @tab @samp{?}
@end multitable

If one wants to work directly with the actual ascii character pressed, then
use @code{e.ascii_char}.
@subsection Event Condition
A convenient class, @code{vgui_event_condition} is defined to
represent the occurrence of a particular event configuration. Its use
is best illustrated by an example:
@example
bool my_tableau::handle(const vgui_event &e)
@{
   vgui_event_condition g0(vgui_LEFT, vgui_CTRL, false);
   if (g0(e))
      vcl_cout << "saw a left mouse button release with CTRL pressed event\n";

   // pass the event back to the parent tableau
   return vgui_my_parent_tableau::handle(e);
@}
@end example
In this case a test for the indicated event condition is constructed
and can be used to filter events passing into a tableau's handle
method. The event condition class
provides a compact and tidy way of expressing complex logic on
modifiers, keys and buttons.
@subsection Mouse Position
An event passes back the position of the mouse when the event
occurred. As was illustrated in the @code{basic09_mouse_position}
example. However this position is in the coordinate system of the
display window.  Most computer vision applications require positions
referenced to the coordinate system of the image being displayed, and
expressed in pixels.  The class @code{vgui_projection_inspector}
provides methods for transforming between the window and image
coordinate systems.

The transformation is illustrated by this code fragment:
@example
// Get X,Y mouse position to display on status bar
// in image coordinates
bool my_image_tableau::handle(const vgui_event &e)
@{
  if (e.type == vgui_MOTION && button_down == false)
   @{
    float pointx, pointy;
    vgui_projection_inspector p_insp;
    p_insp.window_to_image_coordinates(e.wx, e.wy, pointx, pointy);
    int intx = (int)vcl_floor(pointx), inty = (int)vcl_floor(pointy);
    vgui::out << '(' << intx << ' ' << inty << ")\n";
   @}
  return vgui_image_tableau::handle(e);
@}
@end example

@section Building an Application
The essential elements to create a GUI application have been presented.
In this section, a typical design for a main program and associated GUI management classes will be described.
@subsection The Manager
There is a tendency to pile a lot of menu callbacks and menu
constructors into the main program.  It is easy and convenient, but
this approach doesn't stand up to evolution of the program over
time. The main program quickly becomes hopelessly cluttered with a tangle of
processing code, menu callbacks and tableau specifications.

A much better approach is to separate the methods used to process
callbacks and event handling into a singleton class called the
@emph{manager}.  The manager can be a sub-class of the top-level
tableau and thus provide custom processing of events by defining its
own @code{::handle} method.  The methods on the manager provide the
implementation for the menu callbacks.

It is also better to separate the menu construction class from the
main program, since menus also tend to grow in number and complexity
as the application evolves.

The following example will illustrate these design principles. The manager class looks like:
@example
@cartouche
#include <vil/vil_image.h>
#include <vgui/vgui_image_tableau_sptr.h>
#include <vgui/vgui_wrapper_tableau.h>

class basic_manager : public vgui_wrapper_tableau
@{
 public:
  ~basic_manager();
  static basic_manager *instance();
  void quit();
  void load_image();
  void init();
  virtual bool handle(vgui_event const &);

 private:
  basic_manager();
  vil_image img_;
  vgui_image_tableau_sptr itab_;
  static basic_manager *instance_;
@};
@end cartouche
@end example
Some elements of the class design require explaination:
@itemize
@item @code{static basic_manager *instance()}:
This method returns a
unique single instance of the @code{basic_manager} class. This design
is called a @emph{singleton} pattern and is used when the class must
maintain a unique consistent state across applications accessing the
class. This requirement frequently arises in event handling where
global access to the same event process is required. In our example,
All events are funneled through the same @code{basic_manager} instance.

@item @code{basic_manager()}:
The constructor for this class is made private because the only way
the class should be invoked is through the @code{::instance} method.

@item @code{virtual bool handle(vgui_event const &)}:
Since the manager is a sub-class of a @code{vgui_wrapper_tableau} it
inherits the @code{::handle} method.  This inheritance enables the
manager to implement its own event processing and then pass unused
events onto the manager's tableau children.

@item @code{vgui_image_tableau_sptr itab_ }:
To provide convenient access, one can cache pointers to intermediate tableaux.

@item @code{void load_image()}:
A typical menu callback method. This manager can be accessed by many
different applications that need to load an image. Thus, the image gui
management code doesn't have to be continually rewritten.
@end itemize

The implementation of the @code{basic_manager} class is as follows:
@example
@cartouche
#include <vcl_cstdlib.h> // for vcl_exit()
#include <vcl_iostream.h>
#include <vil/vil_load.h>
#include <vgui/vgui.h>
#include <vgui/vgui_dialog.h>
#include <vgui/vgui_viewer2D_tableau.h>
#include <vgui/vgui_shell_tableau.h>
#include <vgui/vgui_image_tableau.h>
#include "basic_manager.h"

//static basic_manager instance
basic_manager* basic_manager::instance_ = 0;

//insure only one instance is created
basic_manager *basic_manager::instance()
@{
  if (!instance_)
  @{
    instance_ = new basic_manager();
    instance_->init();
   @}
  return basic_manager::instance_;
@}

// constructor/destructor
basic_manager::basic_manager():vgui_wrapper_tableau()@{@}

basic_manager::~basic_manager()@{@}

void basic_manager::init()
@{
  itab_ = vgui_image_tableau_new();//keep the image tableau handy
  vgui_viewer2D_tableau_sptr viewer = vgui_viewer2D_tableau_new(itab_);
  vgui_shell_tableau_sptr shell = vgui_shell_tableau_new(viewer);
  this->add_child(shell);
@}
@end cartouche
@end example

Most of this code should be clear.  One subtle point is the method
@code{void basic_manager::init()}.
When the instance of @code{basic_manager} is created, the parent class,
@code{vgui_wrapper_tableau}, is constructed using its default constructor.
After it comes into existence, the rest of the tableau hierarchy can be inserted
as a child of @code{basic_manager}.
With this approach, there is no assumption required about the order of constructors.
@example
@cartouche
//the event handler
bool basic_manager::handle(vgui_event const & e)
@{
  if (e.key == 'b')
    vgui::out << "I saw a 'b'\n";
  //pass the event to the shell
  return this->child.handle(e);
@}

void basic_manager::quit()
@{
  vcl_exit(1);
@}

void basic_manager::load_image()
@{
  vgui_dialog load_image_dlg("Load image file");
  static vcl_string image_filename = "";
  static vcl_string ext = "*.*";
  load_image_dlg.file("Image Filename:", ext, image_filename);
  if (!load_image_dlg.ask())
    return;
  img_ = vil_load(image_filename.c_str());
  itab_->set_image(img_);
@}
@end cartouche
@end example

The manager has a simple basic handle method that looks for the letter
@samp{b}. All events are then passed to the child (shell) tableau for
further processing. This routine could return @code{true} on the
detection of the @samp{b} event if it were desired not to have any of
the child tableaux react.

The methods to support menu callbacks are implemented in the manager.
For example, @code{basic_manager::load_image()} illustrates the use of
a dialog which pops up when the ``Load Image'' menu is selected.
@subsection The Menus
A menu class is defined to package up the static callback functions required
in the @code{vgui_menu} assembly.  The @code{basic_menu} class is:
@example
@cartouche
//basic_menus.h
class basic_menus
@{
 public:
  static void quit_callback();
  static void load_image_callback();
  static vgui_menu get_menu();
 private:
  basic_menus()@{@};
@};
//basic_menus.cxx
#include <vgui/vgui.h>
#include <vgui/vgui_key.h>
#include <vgui/vgui_modifier.h>
#include <vgui/vgui_menu.h>
#include "basic_manager.h"
#include "basic_menus.h"

//Static munu callback functions

void basic_menus::quit_callback()
@{
  basic_manager::instance()->quit();
@}

void basic_menus::load_image_callback()
@{
  basic_manager::instance()->load_image();
@}

//basic_menus definitions
vgui_menu basic_menus::get_menu()
@{
  vgui_menu menubar;
  vgui_menu menufile;

  //file menu entries
  menufile.add( "Quit", quit_callback,(vgui_key)'q', vgui_CTRL);
  menufile.add( "Load Image", load_image_callback, (vgui_key)'l', vgui_CTRL);

  //main menu bar
  menubar.add( "File", menufile);
  return menubar;
@}
@end cartouche
@end example
Note that the menu callback functions are paired with methods on the manager.
These menus can be exported to other gui libraries so that the same menu
functionality can be re-used. However, keep in mind that under Windows special
measures must be taken to export static items.
@subsection The Main Program
The main program for the basic_manager application is:
@example
@cartouche
#include <vgui/vgui.h>
#include <vgui/vgui_adaptor.h>
#include <vgui/vgui_window.h>
#include <vgui/vgui_command.h>
#include <vgui/vgui_shell_tableau.h>
#include <vgui/internals/vgui_accelerate.h>
#include "basic_menus.h"
#include "basic_manager.h"

int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
  vgui::init(argc, argv);
  vgui_menu menubar = basic_menus::get_menu();
  unsigned w = 512, h = 512;
  vcl_string title = "REALLY BASIC";
  vgui_window* win = vgui::produce_window(w, h, menubar, title);
  basic_manager* bas = basic_manager::instance();
  win->get_adaptor()->set_tableau(bas);
  win->set_statusbar(true);
  win->enable_vscrollbar(true);
  win->enable_hscrollbar(true);
  win->show();
  return vgui::run();
}
@end cartouche
@end example
Note that the basic manager instance is attached to the adaptor in
order to receive events, by the expression,
@code{win->get_adaptor()->set_tableau(bas)}. Note that the main
program is now very simple and will stay uncluttered as the
application grows.

Several new features have been included in the construction of this window:
@itemize @bullet
@item a title which appears at the top left of the window
@item a status bar, which displays messages at the bottom of the application
 window.
@item horizontal and vertical scroll bars for panning the tableaux below a
@code{vgui_viewer2D_tableau}.
@end itemize
@section Summary of @code{vgui} Tableaux
The following is a summary of the tableau defined in @code{vgui}.
@multitable @columnfractions 0.33 0.67

@item @code{active_tableau} @tab This tableau (or rather a tableau derived from
it) can appear visible or invisible, and active or inactive by calling
@code{toggle_active} and @code{toggle_visible}.

@item @code{blackbox_tableau} @tab A tableau for event record and playback.

@item @code{blender_tableau} @tab To use this tableau make a
@code{vgui_image_tableau} containing one of the images to blend and a
@code{vgui_blender_tableau} containing the other. Put them both in a
@code{vgui_composite_tableau}.  Set alpha to be less than one to see the blended image.

@item @code{clear_tableau} @tab A tableau that performs OpenGL clearing upon
receipt of a @code{vgui_DRAW} event. It has no child tableau.

@item @code{composite_tableau} @tab The @code{vgui_composite_tableau} class can
have any number of children, indexed from 0 upwards.  The draw action of
@code{vgui_composite_tableau} is to draw each of its children, in order, into
the current context.  Events reaching the @code{vgui_composite_tableau} are
passed on to each child in turn, till it is handled, so that child 0, the first
added, is the "top" tableau.

@item @code{deck_tableau} @tab For holding an ordered collection of child
tableaux, only one of which is passed all events that the @code{vgui_deck_tableau}
receives. The effect is a flick-book of tableaux where the currently active
tableau can be changed using PageUp and PageDown

@item @code{displaylist2D_tableau} @tab Display of two-dimensional geometric objects - a builder tableau usually sub-classed.

@item @code{displaylist3D_tableau} @tab Display of three-dimensional geometric objects - a builder tableau usually sub-classed.

@item @code{drag_tableau} @tab A drag event occurs when the user moves the mouse
with one of the mouse buttons pressed down.  In @code{vgui} there is no
@code{vgui_DRAG} event (there is only @code{vgui_MOTION} for when the mouse
is moving).  So if you want to capture drag events you may find this tableau handy.

@item @code{easy2D_tableau} @tab Easy interface for displaying two-dimensional
geometric objects (see @code{vgui_soview2D}) such as lines, points, circles,
etc. can be added using add, or @code{add_point}, @code{add_line}, @code{add_circle}, etc.

@item @code{easy3D_tableau} @tab Easy interface for displaying three-dimensional
objects (see vgui_soview3D) can be added using add, or @code{add_point}, @code{add_line}, etc.

@item @code{enhance_tableau} @tab Magnify/display another tableau in a region
around the mouse pointer. Useful for a roaming image-processing sub-window.

@item @code{function_tableau} @tab Allows a user to insert custom functions that
are called when events such as draw, mouse up, motion .. etc occur.

@item @code{grid_tableau} @tab A tableau that renders its child tableaux as a rectangular grid.

@item @code{image_tableau} @tab A tableau that renders the given image using an @code{image_renderer}.

@item @code{listmanager2D_tableau} @tab A tableau that manages a set of @code{vgui_displaylist2D_tableau} children

@item @code{loader_tableau} @tab A tableau which (optionally) loads given values
for the projection and modelview matrices before passing control to its child.
This is typically used to initialize GL before rendering a scene.

@item @code{poly_tableau} @tab A tableau which renders its children in
sub-rectangles of its viewport. The @code{grid_tableau} is a sub-class
of @code{poly_tableau}.

@item @code{quit_tableau} @tab A tableau which quits the application on receiving @samp{q} or ESC.

@item @code{roi_tableau} @tab A tableau which makes an ROI of an image act like a whole image.

@item @code{rubberband_tableau} @tab A tableau for interactive drawing of lines, circles, boxes, etc.

@item @code{satellite_tableau} @tab Turns a non-tableau into a multi-tableau,
or puts one tableau into two parts of the hierarchy simultaneously.
Example: We are displaying two images, each in its own zoomer and we'd like to
have a tableau which takes mouse events from one image and draws a line on the
other; introduces a "crossover" in the tree which is difficult to handle without
@code{vgui_satellite_tableau}.

@item @code{shell_tableau} @tab A shell tableau is a handy collection of things
one often wants at the very top of one's tableau hierarchy. It is essentially
an acetate with N utility tableaux at the bottom.

@item @code{text_tableau} @tab A tableau for rendering text.
Each piece of text is associated with an integer handle through which it can be
retrieved, moved about, changed or removed. This tableau will not display any
text unless you have compiled with GLUT.

@item @code{tview_launcher_tableau} @tab A tableau that pops up tableau tree (tview) on @samp{G}.

@item @code{tview_tableau} @tab Displays a tableau tree.

@item @code{viewer2D_tableau} @tab A tableau for zooming and panning 2-d renderings.

@item @code{viewer3D_tableau} @tab A tableau for manipulating 3-d rendered scenes (not completed).

@item @code{wrapper_tableau} @tab A base class tableau which insures only a single child. Useful as a base class for managers.

@end multitable
@section Advanced Topic: Image Display Range
Prior to Jan 2005, image display in @code{vgui_image_tableau} was
limited to 256 (@code{vxl_byte}) levels per pixel component. Images
with pixel data types having a larger dynamic range were clamped to
the range of [0 255]. The @code{vgui_image_tableau} interface now has the method,
@example
@cartouche 
void set_mapping(vgui_range_map_params_sptr const& rmp)
@end cartouche
@end example
which defines how images with a dynamic range larger than one byte are
to be displayed. If the pointer @code{rmp} is null, then the previous vgui display process is carried out as the default, otherwise range mapping is invoked.

For example if the image has @code{unsigned short} pixels, the
intensity can be anything in the range [0 65535]. To generate a
meaningful display, a range, [min max], is specified such that all
pixel intensities less or equal to min are mapped to 0 and all pixel
intensities greater or equal to max are mapped to 255.  Intensities
inside the range are mapped to the [1 254] remaining display levels according
to a gamma or inversion function, as will be described below.

The parameters of the mapping are:
@multitable @columnfractions 0.33 0.67

@item @code{n_components_} @tab The number of components in the image.  A grey level image has one component, a typical RGB image has 3 components.  

@item @code{min_L_} @tab The minimum range value (luminance) for a grey level image.
@item @code{max_L_} @tab The maximum range value for a grey level image.
@item @code{gamma_L_} @tab The gamma factor in the exponential mapping of image intensity.
@item @code{invert_} @tab If true, then the image display is inverted to form a negative image.
@item @code{min_R_} @tab The minimum range value for the red channel in a color image.
@item @code{max_R_} @tab The maximum range value for the red channel in a color image.
@item @code{gamma_R_} @tab The gamma for red channel mapping.
@item @code{min_G_} @tab The minimum range value for the green channel in a color image.
@item @code{max_G_} @tab The maximum range value for the green channel in a color image.
@item @code{gamma_G_} @tab The gamma for green channel mapping.
@item @code{min_B_} @tab The minimum range value for the blue channel in a color image.
@item @code{max_B_} @tab The maximum range value for the blue channel in a color image.
@item @code{gamma_B_} @tab The gamma for green channel mapping.
@item @code{use_glPixelMap_} @tab If @code{true} the range map is processed by hardware when available.
@item @code{cache_mapped_pix_} @tab Under panning and zooming operations, it is not necessary to re-map the pixel intensities.  The range mapped display can be cached to avoid mapping computation by setting @code{cache_mapped_pix_} to @code{true}.
@end multitable                

The @code{gamma} function is defined as 
@example
                          1
        Ig         I     ---
       -----  =  (----) gamma
       Imax       Imax
@end example
Assume that the pixel intensity has been mapped to the range [0 1.0],
e.g., I/Imax.  The normalized intensity is raised to the power
1/gamma. The rationale for this definition is that a typical CRT
display monitor has a non-linear response with exponential factor
gamma.  This correction compensates for the monitor response and
achieves an overall linear intensity display.

In typical operation, the user will interactively adjust the min max
values in a loop that displays the mapped image until a satisfactory
display is produced.  The loop should reinstantiate the parameter block
on each iteration since the update is triggered by a change in the
value of the @code{rmp} pointer.  For example, 
@example
@cartouche
vgui_image_tableau_stpr itab = vgui_image_tableau_new();
...
//set an image on itab
...
//set up a mapping parameter block
unsigned short min_val = 10000, max_val = 40000;
float gamma = 1.0;
bool invert = false;
bool use_glPixelMap = true;
bool cache_buffer = true;

vgui_range_map_params_sptr rmp = 
   new vgui_range_map_params(min_val,max_val, gamma,
                             invert, use_glPixelMap, cache_buffer);
//start range mapping
itab->set_mapping(rmp)
itab->post_redraw();

//change the range
rmp->min_val_ = 15000;
itab->post_redraw();

//the image display will be updated with the new range min value
@end cartouche
@end example

An example of mapping is shown in Figure 13. An example of the inversion mapping for a color image is shown in Figure 14.
