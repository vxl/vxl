@code{vidl} is a library for managing video data.
@code{vidl} supports the following general functions:
@itemize @bullet
@item Reading Video Files
@item Saving Video Files
@item Indexing through Video Files
@end itemize

@code{vidl} has the central notion of a @emph{movie}, which is turn is a
sequence of clips. A @emph{clip} is simply a sequence of frames. A
@emph{frame} can return a @code{vil_image_view} corresponding
to the frame, using the coder/decoder @emph{codec} for a given video format.

Large videos can be read a frame at a time from the codec so it is not
necessary to load an entire video into memory in order to access individual
frames.

Currently vidl supports the following codecs:
@itemize @bullet
@item List of images
@item AVI
@item MPEG (not mature and read only)
@end itemize
There are plans to extend to DVD with a read-only capability

@section The vidl_movie structure
The main interface class in @code{vidl} is @code{vidl_movie} it contains a
list of clips.  The class is meant to reflect a movie structure which is
typically segmented into short independent frame sequences, i.e. clips. The
movie structure hides the clip segments from the user by providing an iterator
that plays through the whole movie. However, most research experiments involve
single clip sequences. Currently a movie file is loaded as a single clip.

The standard interface for getting frames from the movie is through an iterator
as illustrated in the following example:

@example
#include <vidl/vidl_io.h>
#include <vidl/vidl_frame.h>
#include <vidl/vidl_movie.h>
//load the movie
vidl_movie_sptr  my_movie = vidl_io::load_movie("video.avi");

//loop through the frames
vidl_movie::frame_iterator fit(my_movie);
for (fit = my_movie->first(); fit != my_movie->last(); ++fit)
  @{
     vil_image_view<vxl_byte> image = fit->get_view();
     // do something with the image
    ...
  @}
@end example

Most users will operate in this way in accessing the frames of a movie.  The
@code{frame_iterator} allows the user to set forward and backward through the
movie or to access a specific frame.

@section The Codec
Access to video file formats is provided through a standardized interface
called the @emph{codec}, which stands for coder/decoder.  The key tasks of the
codec are to load, save and probe a video file.  The probe detects if the format
of a given file corresponds to any of the available codecs.

The codecs are automatically registered at compile time.  There is no need
to explicitly register codecs as there was in the past.  All codecs that are
compiled will be registered. 

It is difficult to find portable codecs that are open source code for the popular 
video formats.  We are working on an MPEG codec (the current implementation 
doesn't read the header information) that will work on both unix and windows.  
Two AVI codecs are also available.  One uses native windows dlls for handling AVI 
files and compiles in windows.  The other uses the open source avifile library
and compiles in linux.  Unfortunately, the avifile library also uses the windows 
dlls and therefore is only available on x86 machines.

@section File I/O
As we have already seen the @code{vidl} library supports reading and writing
video files.  These functions are handled by the class @code{vidl_io}.
The key methods are illustrated by the following example:

@example
#include <vidl/vidl_io.h>
#include <vidl/vidl_movie.h>
...
  vidl_movie_sptr avi_movie = vidl_io::load_movie("movie.avi");
  if (!avi_movie) @{
    vgui_error_dialog("Failed to load movie");
    return;
  @}
...

//later we save the avi movie as a set of images in the indicated directory

 if (!vidl_io::save(avi_movie, "image_directory" , "ImageList"))
  @{
    vgui_error_dialog("Failed to save movie");
    return;
  @}
...

@end example

@section Conclusion
The @code{vidl} interface is simple and hides most of the difficult aspects of
dealing with video files. Getting MPEG to work at least in read mode across
platforms is an important next step.
