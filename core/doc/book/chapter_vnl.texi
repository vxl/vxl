C++ @emph{can} be like Matlab, but faster and more powerful.
@endchapsummary


The numerics library, @code{vnl} is intended to provide an environment for
numerical programming which combines the ease of use of packages like
Mathematica and Matlab with the speed of C and the elegance of C++.
It provides a C++ interface to the high-quality Fortran routines
made available in the public domain by numerical analysis researchers.

This release includes classes for
@itemize @bullet
@item Matrices and vectors.
The library is based on the old TargetJr/IUE
classes, which provide the standard operations without excessive overhead.

@item
Specialized classes for matrices and vectors with particular properties.
Class @code{vnl_diagonal_matrix} provides a fast and convenient diagonal
matrix, while fixed-size matrices and vectors allow ``fast-as-C''
computations (see @code{vnl_matrix_fixed<T,n,m>} and example subclasses
@code{vnl_double_3x3} and @code{vnl_double_3}).

@item Matrix decompositions.
Classes @code{vnl_svd<T>}, @code{vnl_symmetric_eigensystem<T> },
@code{vnl_generalized_eigensystem}.

@item Real polynomials.
Class @code{vnl_real_polynomial} stores the coefficients
of a real polynomial, and provides methods of evaluation of the polynomial
at any @emph{x}, while class @code{vnl_rpoly_roots} provides a root finder.

@item Optimization.
Classes @code{vnl_levenberg_marquardt}, @code{vnl_amoeba},
@code{vnl_lbfgs}, @code{vnl_conjugate_gradient} allow optimization of
user-supplied functions either with @emph{or without} user-supplied
derivatives.

@item Standardized homes for commonly used functions and constants.
Class @code{vnl_math} defines constants (@code{pi}, @code{e}, @code{eps}...) and
simple functions (@code{sqr}, @code{abs}, @code{rnd}...).
To quote the header ``That's right, @code{M_PI} is nonstandard!''
Class @code{numeric_limits} is from the ISO standard document,
and provides a way to access basic limits of a type.  E.g.
@code{numeric_limits<short>::max()} returns the maximum value of a short.
@end itemize

Most routines are implemented as wrappers around the high-quality Fortran
routines which have been developed by the numerical analysis community over
the last forty years and placed in the public domain.  The central
repository for these programs is the ``netlib'' server
@url{http://www.netlib.org/}.  The National Institute
of Standards and Technology (NIST) provides an excellent search interface
to this repository in its Guide to Available Mathematical Software (GAMS)
at @url{http://gams.nist.gov}, both as a decision tree and a text search.

@subsubheading Compliance with the ANSI standard C++ library
@cindex valarray
The ANSI standard includes classes
for 1-dimensional vectors (@code{valarray<T>}) and complex numbers (@code{
complex<T>}).  There is no standard for matrices.  The current vnl classes
are not implemented in terms of @code{valarray}, as there is a potential
performance hit, but in the future they might be.

@section Example: Basic matrix and vector operations

This section provides a brief tutorial in using the main components of vnl.
The main components which vnl supplies are the vector and matrix classes.
The basic linear algebra operations on matrices and vectors are fully
supported.  Some very brief examples follow, but for the most part the
usage of the @code{vnl_vector} and @code{vnl_matrix} classes is (we hope)
obvious and intuitive.

Using these is easy, and is often modelled on Matlab.  For example, this
declares a 3x4 matrix of @code{double}:
@example
#include <vnl/vnl_matrix.h>
int main()
@{
  vnl_matrix<double> P(3,4);
  return 0;
@}
@end example
Operators are overloaded as expected, so if we have another 3x4
matrix @var{Q}, we can add the two like this
@example
vnl_matrix<double> R = P + Q;
@end example
The @code{vnl_vector} is equally straightforward.  Here we make a 4-element
vector of doubles, premultiply it by @var{P}, and print the result:
@example
vnl_vector<double> X(4);
vcl_cerr << P*X;
@end example
Several more examples are shown in the figure below. @comment @ref{fig:matrixbasics}

@cindex matrix indices, zero based
The vnl matrices are indexed from zero, as in C.  This is always a
difficult decision for C++ matrix libraries, as mathematical matrices use
indices starting from 1---the top left element of @var{A} is generally written
@var{a_11}.  However, efficiently achieving this in C or C++ is a little
bit tricky, and can confuse some tools like Purify.  In the end, it was
decided that zero-based indexing was closer to being ``not weird''.

@subsection Efficiency: Fixed-size matrices and vectors.
A C programmer looking at the above examples will immediately grumble about
the inefficient memory allocation that is being performed.  Let's look into
the construction of @var{P} in more detail.  One can guess that the line
@example
vnl_matrix<double> P(3,4);
@end example
might result in a sequence of actions something like the following:
@example
struct vnl_matrix<double> P;
P.rows = 3;
P.columns = 4;
P.data = new double[P.rows * P.columns];
@end example
The expensive part of this operation is the call to @var{new}, which might
involve many instructions, and even a bit of operating system activity.
(Typically a call to @var{new} or @var{malloc} will cost about as much as a
2x2 matrix multiply).

If the matrices are small, as in these examples, this cost is
significant---if they're bigger than about 20x20 it is not so important.
Always remember, when thinking about efficiency, to consider what else is
going on in the program.  For example, if a matrix is being read from disk,
the time taken to read the matrix will be many times greater than a few
copies.  If you are about to do a matrix multiply (an O(n^3) operation
after all), an O(n^2) copy or an O(1) @var{new} are not going to be hugely
significant.

However, for small matrices we should try to avoid calls to @var{new}, and
vnl provides some fixed-size matrices and vectors which do so.  The templates
which define these are called @code{vnl_vector_fixed} and
@code{vnl_matrix_fixed}, and the template instances include the size of the
vector or matrix in their parameters.  A vector of double with fixed length
4 is defined using
@example
    vnl_vector_fixed<double, 4>
@end example
with analogous syntax for matrices.   Thus a more efficient version of the
above sequence would be
@example
#include <vnl/vnl_matrix_fixed.h>
#include <vnl/vnl_vector_fixed.h>
int main()
@{
  vnl_matrix_fixed<double,3,4> P;
  vnl_vector_fixed<double,4> X;
  vcl_cerr << P*X;
  return 0;
@}
@end example
It's a bit clumsy typing these long names, so it is common to use
@code{typedef} to make shorter ones.  Indeed, a few are supplied with vnl,
for example @code{vnl_double_3x4} (defined, of course, in a header called
@code{vnl_double_3x4.h}).  So a more compact rendition of our
example is
@example
#include <vnl/vnl_double_3x4.h>
#include <vnl/vnl_double_4.h>
int main()
@{
  vnl_double_3x4 P;
  vnl_double_4 X;
  vcl_cerr << P*X;
  return 0;
@}
@end example
Note again that in this example there will be no noticeable speedup,
because 99% of the runtime will be spent on the last line, printing the
vector.

Because some operations such as multiplication have been specially coded
for the fixed-size classes, they are also made more efficient by knowing
the sizes in advance.  For example, this snippet
@example
vnl_double_3x3 R;              // Declare a 3x3 matrix
vnl_double_3 x(1.0,2.0,3.0);   // Declare a 3-vector using
                               // local storage
vnl_double_3 rx = R * x;       // Multiply R by x and place
                               // the result in rx
@end example
is expanded by many compilers into an open-coded sequence of 9 multiplies
and 6 adds.

@subsection Caveats when using the fixed-size classes

@cindex converting vnl_vector_fixed to vnl_vector
@cindex vnl_vector_fixed, converting to vnl_vector
@cindex vnl_matrix_fixed, converting to vnl_matrix
@cindex as_ref()
@cindex non_const()
The fixed-size classes are optimally space efficient;
@code{sizeof(vnl_vector_fixed<double,4>)} and @code{sizeof(double[4])}
are the same. To achieve this, it is necessary to decouple
@code{vnl_vector} from @code{vnl_vector_fixed}, in the sense that
neither inherits from the other. This means that you cannot pass a
@code{vnl_vector_fixed} to a function that expects a @code{vnl_vector}
without some conversion. Luckily, there is a cheap conversion operator
from @code{vnl_vector_fixed} to @code{vnl_vector_ref}, which is a
derived class of @code{vnl_vector}. This conversion operator will be
applied behind the scenes in most cases, so you often don't have to
worry about it.
@example
double norm( vnl_vector<double> const& v );
...
vnl_vector_fixed<double,6> fixed_v;
double n = norm(fixed_v); // this will create a temporary
                          // vnl_vector_ref<double> const
                          // to pass to norm
@end example
The cost of the conversion is on the order of 1 pointer copy (data pointer) and 1
integer copy (length) for a vector and 1 pointer and 2 integers for a
matrix.

Unfortunately, this is not the end of the story. According to the 1998
ISO C++ standard, user defined conversion operators will not be
applied when determining candidate template functions. Therefore, the
following snippet fails to compile.
@example
template<typename T>
T norm( vnl_vector<T> const& v );
...
vnl_vector_fixed<double,6> fixed_v;
// no match for
//    norm(vnl_vector_fixed<double,6>)
// User defined conversion operators are not
// tried since norm is a template.
double n = norm(fixed_v);
@end example
For these cases, and other cases where the implicit conversion
operator cannot be applied, you have to do the conversion explicitly
using @code{as_ref()}.
@example
template<typename T>
T norm( vnl_vector<T> const& v );
...
vnl_vector_fixed<double,6> fixed_v;
double n = norm(fixed_v.as_ref()); // calls norm with
                                   // a vnl_vector_ref<double> const
@end example

When writing general purpose templated functions that are equally useful for
both the dynamically allocated @code{vnl_vector} and statically
allocated @code{vnl_vector_fixed}, it is often useful to provide a
simple forwarding wrapper so that the user is spared the inconvenience
of doing the explicit conversion.
@example
template<typename T>
T norm( vnl_vector<T> const& v );  // real function
template<typename T, unsigned n>
inline
T norm( vnl_vector_fixed<T,n> const& v ) @{ // thin wrapper
   return norm( v.as_ref() );
@}
...
vnl_vector_fixed<double,6> fixed_v;
double n = norm(fixed_v); // this calls the second norm
@end example

The final wrinkle with mixing @code{vnl_vector} and
@code{vnl_vector_fixed} is that the conversion operators, both the
implicit and explicit, create temporary @code{vnl_vector_ref} objects,
which, according to the standard, cannot bind to non-const
references. Therefore, you cannot pass these to a mutator function
that modifies the values in your vector.
@example
void mutator( vnl_vector<double>& v );
...
vnl_vector_fixed<double,6> fixed_v;
mutator(fixed_v); // the temporary object created by the
                  // conversion is const => cannot be
                  // passed to mutator.
@end example
The only solution to this is to explicitly force the temporary object
to ``give away'' it's constness, using the @code{non_const()}
method in @code{vnl_vector_ref}.
@example
void mutator( vnl_vector<double>& v );
...
vnl_vector_fixed<double,6> fixed_v;
mutator(fixed_v.as_ref().non_const());
@end example

The discussion above applies equally well to @code{vnl_matrix} and
@code{vnl_matrix_fixed}.

@section Example: Matrix decomposition

The most frequently asked question about @code{vnl_matrix} is ``where is
the @code{inverse} method'', and the answer is that the inverse is not
defined as a method, because there are too many ways of forming it, each
with different tradeoffs.  If you really don't care to hear about these
things, you can use the @code{vnl_matrix_inverse} class to compute an
inverse object:
@example
#include <vnl/algo/vnl_matrix_inverse.h>
int main()
@{
  vcl_cerr << vnl_matrix_inverse<double>(A) * B;
  return 0;
@}
@end example

If you want more control over how the inverse is taken, then you might want
to look at @code{vnl_inverse} or at one of the decomposition classes.

TODO - order in general-specific, give flop counts, show decomps.


The following fragment demonstrates use of the @code{vnl_svd<double>} class
to find the approximation of a 3x3 matrix @code{F} by the nearest matrix of
rank 2
@example
vnl_double_3x3 rank2_approximate(const vnl_double_3x3& F)
@{
  // Compute singular value decomposition of F
  vnl_svd<double> svd (F);
  // Set smallest singular value to 0
  svd.W(2,2) = 0;
  // Recompose vnl_svd<double> into UWV^T
  return vnl_double_3x3(svd.recompose());
@}
@end example

A more extensive example of the use of linear algebra is provided in
Figure 2, which contains a program to fit a hyperplane to
points read from standard input.

#include <vcl_iostream.h>

  // Read points from stdin
  vnl_matrix<double> pts;

@section Polynomials

The @code{vnl_rpoly_roots} class in @code{vnl/algo} is used to compute
the roots (or "zeros") of a real polynomial.   For example, given the
cubic equation
@example
     4 x^3 + 3 x^2 - 7 x + 5 = 0
@end example
we can compute the values of @code{x} using @code{vnl_rpoly_roots}.
The first step is to collect the coefficients into a vector, listing
from the highest power down.  In the above example, we should make the
vector
@example
     [4, 3, -7, 5]
@end example
In C++, this could be written
@example
     vnl_double_4 poly;
     poly[0] = 4;
     poly[1] = 3;
     poly[2] = -7;
     poly[3] = 5;
@end example
Having prepared the polynomial, we compute the roots:
@example
     vnl_rpoly_roots roots(poly);
@end example
Now, @code{roots} contains the roots, which can be made use of, or simply
admired.  To facilitate the latter, we shall print them to the console:
@example
     for (int k = 0; k < 3; ++k) // Cubic polynomial ==> 3 roots
       vcl_cerr << roots[k] << vcl_endl;
@end example

To get just the real or imaginary parts of the (generally complex) roots,
convenience methods @code{real(int)} and @code{imag(int)} are provided.  So
to print only the real roots, one might use
@example
     for (int k = 0; k < 3; ++k)
       if (roots.imag(k) < 1e-8)
         vcl_cerr << roots.real(k) << vcl_endl;
@end example

@subsection Implementation

The implementation is a wrapper for the fortran code in algorithm 493 from
the ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software.  This is the Jenkins-Traub
algorithm, described by Numerical Recipes under "Other sure-fire
techniques" as "practically a standard in black-box polynomial
rootfinders".  (See M.A. Jenkins, ACM TOMS 1 (1975) pp. 178-189.).

The algorithm fails if poly[0] is zero, so it's often good to try to write
your problem so that the leading coefficient (i.e. poly[0]) is equal to 1.


@section Nonlinear Optimization
It is not uncommon in computer vision research to meet problems for which
there is no known closed-form solution, and a common class of such problems
are of the form "find @math{x}, @math{y} and @math{z}, such that the
function @math{f(x,y,z)} takes its minimum value".  For example, fitting a
line to a set of 2D points @{(x_i,y_i) | i=1..n@}. The problem is then
to find a,b,c to minimize the sum of distances of each point to the line
(@math{a x + b y + c = 0})
@example
                  n   (a * x[i] + b * y[i] + c)^2
      f(a,b,c) = sum  ---------------------------
                 i=1         (a^2 + b^2)
@end example
In the case of line fitting, a closed-form solution can be found, but in
many other problems, no such solution is known, and an iterative method
must be employed.

In those cases, one needs a good, general purpose nonlinear optimization
routine.  Of course, such a panacea does not exist, so @code{vnl} provides
several from which to choose.  The factor that decides which is best is
most frequently the amount of knowledge that one has about the form of the
function.  The more you know, the more quickly you can expect the
optimization to proceed.  For example, if you can compute the function's
derivatives, you would expect to achieve better performance.

@subsection Choosing a minimizer

The routines provided in vnl may be arranged roughly in decreasing order of
generality---and correspondingly, increasing order of speed---as follows:
@enumerate
@item @code{vnl_amoeba}: Nelder-Meade downhill simplex.  The method of
choice if you know absolutely nothing about your function, but fear the
worst.  It you think the function might be noisy (i.e. the error surface
has many small pockets), or you don't trust it to have reasonable
derivatives, downhill simplex is a good choice.  If you want the code to
run fast, it's not.

@item @code{vnl_powell}: Powell's direction-set method.  Powell's method,
like simplex, doesn't require that you supply the derivatives of @math{f}
with respect to @math{a}, @math{b}, and @math{c}, but it does assume they
are moderately well behaved.

@item @code{vnl_conjugate_gradient}: Fletcher-Reeves form of the conjugate
gradient algorithm.

@item @code{vnl_lbfgs}: Limited memory Broyden Fletcher Goldfarb Shannon
minimisation. Requires 1st derivatives. Considered to be the best
general optimisation algorithm for functions which are well behaved
(i.e. locally smooth without too many local minima.)

@item @code{vnl_levenberg_marquardt}: The Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm for
least-squares problems. This is usually the best method for any function
which can be expressed as
@code{f(x) = (f_1 (x))^2 + (f_2(x))^2 + (f_3(x))^2 + \dots}
@c Should get @math fixed. I think the @catcode92=12 is interfering.

@end enumerate

As an example of the use of the optimization routines, we'll use a common
test case, the ``notorious'' Rosenbrock function:
@example
     f(x, y) = (10*(y - x^2))^2 + (1-x)^2
@end example
The graph of @math{f} is plotted in Figure 2.

@figure

@caption{2}

case.  Optimization starts on one side of the valley, and must find the
minimum around the corner.
@endcaption
@endfigure

@subsection Function objects, derived from @code{vnl_cost_function}

Running an optimization is a two step process.  The first is to describe
the function to the program, and the second is to pass that description to
one of the minimizers.  Functions are described by @emph{function objects},
or "functors", which are classes which provide a method @code{f(...)} which
takes a vector of parameters as input, and returns the error.  Such
functors are derived from @code{vnl_cost_function}:
@example
     struct my_rosenbrock_functor : public vnl_cost_function @{
@end example
The function is a method in the derived class.  Here's the continuation of
the declaration of @code{my_rosenbrock_functor}.
@example
       double f(vnl_vector<double> const& params) @{
         double x = params[0];
         double y = params[1];
         return vnl_math_sqr(10*(y-x*x)) + vnl_math_sqr(1-x);
       @}
@end example
Because a @code{vnl_cost_function} can deal with cost functions of any
dimension, not just the 2D example here,
@code{my_rosenbrock_functor} must tell the base class the size of the
space it's working in.  This is done in the constructor as follows:
@example
       my_rosenbrock_functor():
         vnl_cost_function(2) @{@}
@end example
And we can now close the declaration of @code{my_rosenbrock_functor}:
@example
     @}
@end example


@c
@c We first derive a function object from @code{vnl_least_squares_function}.
@c The function object must initialize the base class with the number of
@c variables, and the number of residuals or unknowns.  In this case, both
@c domain and range are two dimensional.  The constructor must also supply a
@c @code{no_gradient} flag if the function @code{gradf} has not been
@c implemented.
@c @example
@c struct Rosenbrock : public vnl_least_squares_function
@c @{
@c   Rosenbrock(): vnl_least_squares_function(2, 2, no_gradient) @{@}
@c @};
@c @end example
@c
@c Then the abstract method @code{f} is implemented, which evaluates the
@c function.  Any data required for the evaluation can be stored in the class
@c and will be available whenever @code{f} is called.
@c @example

@subsection Running the minimization

In order to perform the minimization, a @code{vnl_amoeba} compute
object is constructed, passing the @code{vnl_cost_function}.
@example
my_rosenbrock_functor f;
vnl_amoeba minimizer(f);
@end example
Having provided an initial estimate of the solution in vector @code{x}, the
minimization is performed:
@example
minimizer.minimize(x);
@end example
after which the vector @code{x} contains the minimizing parameters.

@subsection Least-squares problems: The Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm.

The Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm provides only for nonlinear least
squares, rather than general function minimization.  This means that the
function to be minimized must be the norm of a multivariate function.
However, this often the case in vision problems, and allows us to use the
powerful Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm.  The Rosenbrock function can also
be written as a 2D-2D least squares problem as follows:
@example
f(x, y) = [ 10(y - x^2) ]
          [    1-x      ]
@end example
In this case, we need to make a class derived from
@code{vnl_least_squares_function}.  TODO

@section Design issues (Developer Topic)
This section documents some design decisions with which people might
disagree.  Please let me know how you feel on these issues.  It's also a
malleable to-do list.  The most important consideration has been to
provide simple lightweight interfaces that nevertheless allow for maximum
efficiency and flexibility.

@subsection Computation in constructors
@anchor{sec:computors}
As noted above, a common model in this package is that the compute objects
perform computation within the constructors.  While this is slightly
distasteful from a traditional C++ viewpoint, it offers a number of
advantages in both efficiency and ease of use.

The philosophical argument, say in the case of SVD, is that SVD is a noun.
The natural description is "The SVD of a matrix M" which is expressed in
C++ as @code{vnl_svd<double> svd(M) }.

Storage for the results of a computation is provided by the compute object
which is convenient, allowing client code to access only those results in
which it is interested.  Local storage is also more efficient, as objects
are constructed at the correct size, and initialized immediately.  In
contrast, passing empty objects to a function will generally involve a
resize operation, while returning a structure will incur a speed penalty
due to the necessary copy operations.

Namespace clutter is avoided in the @code{vnl_matrix} class.  While svd()
is a perfectly reasonable method for a matrix, there are many other
decompositions that might be of interest, and adding them all would make
for a very large matrix class, even though many methods might not be of
general interest.

The model extends readily to @math{n}-ary operations such as generalized
eigensystems, which combine two objects to produce others.  Such operations
cannot be methods on just one matrix.

@subsection Fixed-size classes
The classes which provide for fast fixed-size matrices and vectors are
essential in a system which wants to make claims for efficiency.  In
addition, a great many uses of these objects @emph{do} know the size in
advance.  In this case code using say @code{vnl_double_3} is more efficient (as
well as more self-documenting) than the equivalent referring to a
@code{vnl_vector} of unknown size.

@subsection Transposing for Fortran
In calling Fortran code, the first difficulty that becomes apparent is that
Fortran arrays are stored column-wise, while traditional `C' arrays are
stored row-wise -- a trend that is followed by the @code{vnl_matrix} class.
One solution is simply to store C++ arrays column-wise, and this was an
early plan for the IUE.

I have not done anything to alleviate this for two reasons -- most routines
we call are expensive enough (i.e. @math{O(n^3)}) that the @math{O(n^2)} copy
operation is only a small performance hit.  Secondly, many decompositions
satisfy a transpose-equivalence relationship.  For example suppose we wish
to use a Fortran matrix multiply which has been hand-optimized for some
particular machine.  Such a routine may be declared
@example
mmul(A, B, C) // Computes C = A B, fortran storage
@end example
To use this with row-stored arrays, we recall the simple identity
@example
C = (C')' = (B' A')' = AB
@end example
and therefore call @code{mmul(B, A, C)}, reversing the order of parameters
@math{A} and @math{B}.  The fortran code will lay down the result of
@math{B' A'} into the columns of @math{C}, thereby computing @math{C' =
B' A'} from the point of view of the caller.

This however, doesn't apply to the vnl_svd<double>, as algorithms generally require only the
``economy-size'' version where size(U) = size(M) in @math{U S V' = M}.  This
is @math{O(mn^2)} flops rather than @math{O(m^2n)} for the full size one.  Using the
transpose-equivalence would mean a doubling of the computation time, as the
``economy-size'' decomposition is only implemented for @math{m > n}.  If someone
does need the full size decomposition, a flag could be added or a new @code{vnl_svd}
class written.

@item Question 1

@quotation
I would like to do constrained optimisation.
Can I add constraints to the existing optimisers
in @file{vnl/algo}?
@end quotation

Unfortunately, this approach is not likely to solve your problem,
since constrained optimisation is not in general solved by adding
constraints to an unconstrained optimiser.

The usual approaches to doing constained optimisation are:
@enumerate
@item
Work the constraints into your cost function, heavily penalising any
breach in the constraints.
@item
Find a mapping T :[your constrained space]->R^n
 and use f(T^-1(x)) as your const function instead of f.
@item
If problem has linear constrains and a simple cost function
(linear or quadratic) then there is code out there for your problem,
but unfortunately not yet in VXL.
@end enumerate
@end table

@section Future work
Many of the existing methods are unimplemented, or could benefit from
optimization.  Users can contribute code to address these deficiencies
based on the existing examples, and using the conversion hints in
Appendix~A.  In addition there are many algorithms that ought to be
included, listed roughly in order of priority:
@itemize @bullet

@item
Additional matrix decompositions in the same vein, including an updateable
QR, a basic LU, etc.

@item Choice of back-end functions---for optimization one might prefer Powell,
or even simulated annealing.  For matrix decompositions, particular users
might prefer to interface to NAG or IMSL routines.  These choices must be
allowed to be made easily, thereby encouraging the comparison of algorithms
and of alternative implementations.

@item Many classes are defined as double-only rather than templated.
I will use default template arguments when the compilers support them.
