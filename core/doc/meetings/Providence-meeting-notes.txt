0. Interest in VXL

For those present at the beginning of the day, there was a round of
introductions with brief statements about each person's interest in
VXL.

Joe Mundy: Will be using VXL for video processing -- both bulk
processing from files and processing of live video.

Fred Wheeler: Using VXL for image enhancement/super-resolution work.

Andrew Fitzgibbon: Using VXL for bulk processing of video for
applications where Matlab is too slow.  His students are using VXL.
Current strategy for promoting VXL is to not tell anybody about TargetJr.

Peter Tu: GE use of VXL includes real-time metrology, computer vision
for surveillance, and medical applications.

Amitha Perera: Rensselaer uses VXL for applications in tracing blood
vessels in retinal images.  They make heavy use of VIL.  Rensselaer
has developed and uses robust estimation techniques (in vxl/vnl and
rpl).

Ian Scott: Using VXL for object finding and recognition. We indirectly
force some students to use VXL. Some of these students have no CS
background.

Luis Galup: Used TargetJr in the past.  Working on video and tracking.
Would like to do 3D image processing in VXL.

Tim Cootes: Has used VXL for two years now.  Would like to see a
common image library in VXL.  Uses VXL for statistical models of
appearance and shape.

Peter Vanroose: Is migrating from TargetJr to VXL, and currently using
both.  Using VXL for object recognition and 3D modeling.

Geoff Cross: Currently promoting the use of Matlab as a front-end to
VXL.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. VIL2

Ian Scott gave a presentation on the plans for vil2, which is meant to
replace the current vil.  With these minutes you should find his
slides in the file "vil2talk.ppt".  These minutes assume you have the
presentation also.  Without duplicating what is present in the
presentation slides, additional comments and discussions are noted
here.

Slide "Good points about existing vil": vil2 will be considerably
easier to develop because large image support (entire image not in
memory) will be changed.  This should not bother anyone because large
image support is not as complete in vil as one might think.

Slide "Problems with existing vil": Tim has done experiments
confirming that on modern computers arithmetic indexing is faster than
pointer based indexing.  The multiplications are faster than the
memory lookups.

Slide "Philosophy 3": vil2 will readily extend to 3D, however, that
extension will not be put in vil2.

A vil2_image_view does not have its own data.  A view tells how to
access underlying data properly as an image, regardless of how the
underlying data is structured.

vil2 is currently under development in vxl/mul/vil2.  There are actual
working examples available.  It was noted that having actual working
examples is a new approach for VXL.

Joe Mundy: Indexing an image with x,y implies to some that there is a
Cartesian coordinate system.  But this is not the case with the origin
in the upper left.  Suggests changing to r,c or i,j.

Ian Scott: A vil2_image_view to switch you to r,c or i,j can be constructed.

Ian Scott: An open issue is whether indices should be signed or unsigned.

There was consensus that indices should be unsigned.  If you are
accessing an image with negative coordinate, then you should call it
something else because it is not an image.

Slide "Examples 2 and 6": The flip and transpose operations are
accomplished entirely by manipulation of stepx, stepy and stepplane in
the view.

Slide "Example 5": resize() does not preserve data.  This is different
than STL behavior, but nobody would expect data preservation during an
image resize.

It was suggested that the name resize() be changed since its behavior
is different than might be expected.

Slide "File Example 1": Ian is open to suggestion on changes to get
rid of the "delete" in this example.

It was agreed that get_view should be renamed new_view as Amitha
suggests.  This helps to emphasize that what is returned must be
deleted.  Also, a new function will be needed to replace get_view().


There was a call for a vote on the meaning of equality for vil2 views.
The choices would be.

1.a.  As file_ex1 is written, and get_view returns a pointer
1.b.  As file_ex1 is written, and get_view returns a smart pointer
2.    ??? Something else.

There was general consensus around option 1.b.  Using _sptr here is
type proliferation, but in a way the people are used to.

Ian Scott will make sure examples using option 1.b. will get coded.

Slide "File Example 2": We should standardize on functions expecting
the arguments top,left,width,height to specify regions.  Any function
that does otherwise should have a name that makes this obvious.

Slide "File Example 3": The first line will now use a smart pointer
(resolved during previous discussion).  One result will be that lines
1 and 2 can be merged.

Open issue: What happens when you try to save a file-image (image not
all in memory) to disk?  This is not done now, and is not supported in
vil2.

* Polymorphic registered images

The library mul/vilt was named for vil+transform, but has now been
renamed to mul/vimt.

AWF: This is a clip-on.

Ian Scott: vimt will not be integrated into vil2.

It was agreed that vimt is important enough to keep.  There was some
discussion on the difficulty of deciding where to try the line
delimiting which types is transforms should be supported.

* Questions

- Which indexing scheme

It was decided that the parameter and example index variable names
should be i,j,p for 2D images and i,j,k,p should be used for 3D images.
These variable names will
be used in the function declarations. The size functions were
agreed to be ni, nj, nplanes.

- Which index type

It was decided that unsigned should be used.

* Conversion/Integration process

vil2 is currently in mul/vil2 and all are encouraged to use it.

Soon vil2 will be moved to vxl/vil2 and then vxl/vil will be moved
outside of vxl, but will be kept in the tree.

Having vil2 working in vxl/vil2 will not be a requirement for release
1.0.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. VNL

[I missed the first 5 minutes -Fred Wheeler]

Brad King and Bill Hoffman (Kitware) called in to discuss their new
implementation of vnl_vector and vnl_matrix.  A design goal is to have
both fixed and variable sized vectors and matrices with the fixed size
versions using just enough memory for the elements themselves (no
length, etc.).

They use a parent class with the type and memory policy and two
subclasses, one fixed size and one variable size.  A concern is that
if this were adopted in VXL, each vnl function would have a templated
wrapper laid down 3 times.

* discussion on backward compatibility

Code that currently takes a vnl_vector would not work with the new
template and there is a lot of code that uses vnl_vector.

There was much discussion on how to wrap fixed and variable sized
templated vectors and when to do it.

Amitha agreed to meet with Brad King and Bill Hoffman back at Kitware
to hash out some ideas on how to improve vnl_vector.

* ITK and VTK

Bill Hoffman discussed the relationship with ITK and VTK.  ITK has
adopted VNL.

* VCL

Bill was asked for his thoughts on VCL.

Bill responded that VCL is not liked.  To avoid using something like
VCL, ITK forces people to use a relatively new compiler, like msvs6 or
gcc-2.95.  VTK takes the least common denominator approach as to what
parts of the C++ language are allowed.  A problem with VCL is that it
is very heavy on the macros and thus hard to debug.  Most people
cannot fix problems they encounter with VCL.  The VCL plan is that one
expert makes it work once, and then everyone can use it.  But this
hinders experimentation with new compilers/machines by those who are
not VCL experts.

Soon CMake will support "try run" and "try compile".  This will give
CMake capabilities like GNU autoconf.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. VGUI

[I missed the first 15 minutes -- Lousy Providence parking
rules. -Fred Wheeler]

Karen McGaul called in for the VGUI discussion.

A common approach to using VGUI is to use a toolkit such a gtk, qt or
mfc for menus and buttons and to use a vgui/opengl section inside the
main GUI.

Joe Mundy: VGUI should be promoted to vxl/vgui.  It will get better
support as a top-level library.  Also, the vgui dead tendrils should
be removed.

Karen McGaul agreed to remove the the implementations other than the
core implementations (gtk, qt, mfc) and to remove the event-loop code.

There was agreement that the vgui improvement plan in Karen McGaul's
recent e-mail is a good plan.  Karen and Andrew Fitzgibbon will meet
back at Oxford to implement the planned changes in Karen's e-mail.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. VIDL

Karen McGaul and Luis Galup are on the telephone line.

It is agreed that vxl/vidl is useful and necessary.

Joe Mundy: We need more codecs.  We should be able to handle .mov
files and write mpeg2.

vxl/vidl needs a chapter in the VXL Book.

The vidl API has a signed/unsigned mix that should be fixed up.

Joe Mundy: We should discuss which codecs we want and who will insert them.

Ian Scott: Manchester has an AVI codec that they can donate to vidl.
This codec uses an executable that will work only on Intel/Linux.

Joe Mundy: We'll want to read data from DVDs (VOB, LST files).

Fred Wheeler agrees to find out about open source MPEG2 encoders and
also about open source MPEG2 header parsers.  Joe Mundy would like to
be pointed toward an open source MPEG2 header parser.

It was agreed that we need to be able to read MPEG headers to automate
the mux/demux decision and to find the image size.

It may be the case that the current implementation will decode VOB
files if mux/demux is set correctly.

AWF: There is a way to get the image size out of the mpeg2dec library
via a callback.  This was done in oxl/...

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. Matlab

Oxford uses the VXL Canny edge detector from Matlab via an executable.

Geoff Cross has been making Matlab mex interfaces with VXL by hand.
(Geoff was not on the line at the time.)

Bill Hoffman suggested that we might be able to do automatic Matlab
wrapping with CABLE (Kitware product using gcc-XML).

CABLE may also be able to help VXL make DLLs in windows.  Brad King
would know about this.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

6. MUL Upgrades

Ian Scott discussed mul code that others may be interested in and that
may be ready for promotion to vxl top-level libraries.

mul/mil is being converted and integrated into vil2.

If anything from mul is promoted into vxl, then the polymorphic non-templated
iterators in mul/mbl will have to be promoted (probably to vbl) because it
is heavily used.  There was a discussion of where the many vbl-vnl
templates should go. If both libraries are
at the top-level, then neither can hold the shared templates because
no interdependency is allowed at the top-level. A separate Templates
directory most likely.

vpdfl is a standard representation for PDFs used by Manchester code.
There is consensus that vpdfl should be merged with pdf1d and
go into vxl after someone else trys using it a bit. The use of
the builder-model-instance pattern was ascribed to Manchester's use
of/belief in the "high object style"

Also available is clsfy, which can produce many types of classifiers,
including a support vector machine, and adaboost.

Ian also suggests promoting mbl_mz_random.

It was agreed that mbl_erf and mbl_gamma should be promoted to
somewhere in vnl.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

7. RREL Promotion

Rensselaer would like to promote rrel (Robust Estimation) into
vxl/vnl.  Chuck Stewart (Rensselaer) may get funding for Amitha Perera
to do this.

The group feels that what rrel does needs to be better documented.
Amitha noted that rrel has RANSAC, and many other related algorithms
that he feels are superior.  There is a need to distinguish what rrel
does from minimization.

rrel contains several algorithms that perform robust estimation, like
RANSAC.  All work on problems for which parameters are estimated such
that a set of residuals is minimized, and some of the residuals are
outliers and should be removed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

8. Image Processing

There was a discussion of vipl.  There is a concern that some people
are afraid of the profuse templates. Ian said he found it relatively
easy to extend and use, but that it leaked memory.

The group viewed the vipl and vepl interfaces in Doxygen.  AWF
commented that the vepl examples look great.

This discussion was interrupted to discuss ITK.  It is continued
below in section 10.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

9. ITK

Jim Miller (GE) called in to discuss ITK and answer questions.

The U.S. National Library of Medicine (NLM) funds ITK.  We are at the
end of the original 3 year contract period, but that period will be
extended by 1 year and more contracts are coming.

Q.:  Will NIH mandate ITK for its funded research projects?

Jim Miller: Yes.

Joe Mundy: The lack of cooperation between government agencies will
probably prevent this mandate.

Jim Miller has got an application working that links ITK, VTK and VXL.
It is easy for ITK to use VXL.  It's easy to get the data into ITK,
just pass a block pointer back and forth.

ITK has a data pipelining process.  This supports a GUI building block
design.  The pipelining helps algorithms work on very large data sets
by feeding in a section at a time.  Each block can be multi-threaded.

ITK classes tend to have a lot of template parameters.  People are
trying to reduce this.

AWF: What should VXL do to make it easier to use from ITK?

Jim: 1. There are some VNL issues.  2. It is mostly pretty easy right
now.

VTK uses tcl or python bindings.  Wrappers cannot be generated
automatically for ITK because of the templates.

The big algorithms in ITK are: watershed, mutual information based
registration, level sets, classification hierarchy.

VXL could use an ITK algorithm by wrapping it in a function and faking
the pipelined I/O.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

10. Image Processing, continued from section 8.

The discussion returned to image processing.

Ian Scott proposed that image processing go in vxl/vil/algo.
Algorithms would operate on both vil2_image_views (N in, M out) in
memory, and would operate on vil_image_data, stitching together tiles
of data. The useful code in tbl/vipl would be converted to vil/algo, and
then we would dump vipl and vepl.

AWF proposed that we skip the stitching.

Amitha Perera suggested that we start by making algorithms in
vxl/vil/algo only operate on memory images, and add operations on file
images only when they are needed. This was agreed by consensus/

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

11. Image Formats

Manchester University does not want to write the code for these image
formats: viff, mit, tiff.  They plan to do most of the work, but want
others to fill in the gaps.

Consensus is that the tiff format is important, but the mit format is
not.

Fred Wheeler needs tiff support and offered to do it.  Other suggested
that we first try to find out who put the tiff support in vil, and ask
them to put it into vil2.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

12. Closing Comments

It was suggested that it would be a good idea to automatically check
that the examples in the VXL Book compile.

Image processing code will go in vxl/vil/algo.

Manchester University would like everyone to look at vil2 and to fix
and/or report bugs.

vil2 functions should take inputs first, then outputs: function(input,
..., output, ...).  Inputs before outputs is preferred everywhere in
VXL, even though this is contrary to the equals '=' operation.

There was a vigorous discussion over whether to use native type names
like int and char or to use specific VXL type names like vxl_uint8 and
vxl_sint32 in vil2.  One concern is that vxl_uint8 is odd looking to
new users.

Goals:

* VXL 1.0 in 2-3 months with these requirements
  - vgui a level 2, VXL-status library
  - vidl, vcsl get documented (Peter Tu has a vcsl document, not in
    texinfo, needs to be converted)

Question: Should the VXL Book be split into a users books and a
developers book.  vsl has a lot of sections of developer interest
only.  There are several other sections labeled "developer topic".
Ian Scott will remove the developer topic sections in vsl and put them
in an appendix.

vbl_bounding_box_DIM and vbl_*tuple* should be removed.
