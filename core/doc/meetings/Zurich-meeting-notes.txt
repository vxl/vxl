Minutes of the vxl meeting held in Zurich, 29-30 March 2001.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
0. Historic tour - Joe Mundy

Already in 1972, GE/CRD developed image processing software (Fortran;
"operator" paradigm).  In 1980 came lisp, and the "object modeling"
paradigm.  1990 was the birth of TargetJr when C++ was chosen to
replace lisp.

Why software environments?
- accumulate individual efforts (hence faster development of new software)
- direct research-to-application delivery (would be impossible in Matlab)
- as a comparison tool for research results


----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Research groups and their objectives

Zurich:
        Andreas Turina, Stephan Scholze, Dominique

        Coming in mostly as users of vxl. Interests are in biomedical
        modeling, using vxl for visualisation and for general
        algorithmic support. Looking for simplicity--vxl is a tool,
        and should therefore be easy to use. Concerns include
        confusion with the different types of points, and the
        inability to conveniently switch between them for different
        algorithms.  The vxl group is currently 3. Some current TJr
        users *may* switch, depending on the progress of vxl.

Leuven:
        Peter Vanroose

        Leuven's 3D reconstruction people are using vxl the most
        (mostly vnl/vil). vgl is not (yet) good enough for them - they
        have their own. (They, however, removed vcl and use standard
        C++ directly.) They work with SGIs (IRIX might be going out,
        Linux coming in), Solaris, and a few Alphas. TJr/Parmesan
        people shifting toward vxl. They are struggling with the
        current GUI stuff. vtk being used by the 3D visualisation
        people. Others will want a GUI. Peter guesses about 5 active
        people, 15 maybes.

RPI:
        Chuck Stewart, Amitha Perera

        Chuck has taught vision and programming classes using
        TJr. Successful because of "complicated" algorithms, and
        unsuccessful because of learning ramp. vxl will hopefully
        avoid the latter. Some research will need to be "real time",
        so performance and lightweight is important. RPI has many
        relatively naive users; vxl must cater for them. RPI is going
        towards building a web interface for retina project
        software. Simplicity in design and reliability of code are
        paramount; completeness and generality is much less
        important. Multi-platform build environment is essential. The
        retina project may move to Insight (possibly for political
        reasons). Problem with Insight is that it may grow very big
        very quickly; it is very dynamic.

Oxford:
        Andrew Fitzgibbon, Frederik Schaffalitzky, Karen McGaul

        Basic principles of vxl: not slow, not heavy (learning and
        compiling), not weird. Outcomes: limited scope (e.g. image
        library just loads many formats; doesn't do much else). vxl
        will develop and harden through use--basic stuff written,
        others add as the need arises. vcl is important, as there is
        no standard compiler available. They use xcv, which is meant
        to be a program that demonstrates everything in vxl.

GE:
        Geoff Cross, Joe Mundy, Peter Tu, Don Hamilton

        GE is working towards some kind of merger between vxl and
        vtk. Not really combining, but some sort of "link" -- exchange
        data, etc. Compute in vxl, display in vtk. GE is also working
        on developing the topology libraries for vxl. They are
        developing/porting, in collaboration with INRIA(?), some line
        and curve fitting code.

Manchester:
        Tim Cootes, Ian Scott

        Have about 20 people working with Radial, which is a
        Manchester only library. Thinking about using a more general
        and widely used library, so enable algorithm exchange,
        etc. Research is mostly on medical and face modeling. Uses Qt
        library for GUI. They are still evaluating vxl. Latest
        contribution was fixing documentation, and adding the viol
        library for binary output. If they make the switch, they would
        contribute modeling software. Requirements: believable coding
        standard, consistency, documentation, easy to learn (convince
        others to use), 3D images, and possibly 4D images. Need to be
        able to persuade people to use this and not Matlab.

ANU:
        Richard Hartley
        Just have vxl up and running. Plan just to use it.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Input for vxl from a new user's perspective

* code should work with/without environment. That is, it should mostly
  be a set of libraries with as few constraints as possible. It should
  be possible to use the code in other projects/environments

* vxl should try to be "popular"--be accepted by the vision community
  in general.

* need much more documentation!

* representation and procedure should be separated, as in, for
  example, vnl and vnl-algo. This is a design issue. It is not to
  imply that representation and procedure should be in different
  libraries. However, good algorithm implementations need not be
  rewritten, may use internal data structures. It's important that
  they are there.


* need a computation geometry library.

* vxl "core" consists on the "good, widely loved" code. gel/oxl/etc
  are for works-in-progress, functional but poorly documented code,
  etc. But criticism on this concept because looks unstable, or at
  least "subject to change without notice".

* there shouldn't be a halfway house for code promotion. (That is,
  there is no "candidate for core" set of libraries.) Such a thing
  would cause many libraries to just sit there. Also, the
  definition/expectation of such a halfway house would be
  controversial.

* For new users there are currently not enough useful non-trivial
  algorithms, s.c. "killer demos" in vxl, like Canny, ...


----------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Documentation

* Use doxygen for documentation. Manchester will write a chapter of
  The Book describing the style (below). Manchester will remove old
  documentation generation mechanisms in favour of uniform use of
  doxygen. Better no documentation than broken documentation.

* Run doxygen on each individual library (vim, vnl, ...) and add an
  overview page that links to those.

* vxl will not provide routines to search the documentation; it will
  be left to an external process (e.g. web search engine).

* Class documentation should preferably appear in the header
  file. (This is where doxygen pulls it from.)

* Each library should have an overview document. This should appear in
  The Book. Andrew will fix the book to compile over CVS.

* The book, and other similar documentation, will continue to be
  written in TeXinfo, since it gives the most reasonable online and
  printed output. Andrew will provide a link for TeXinfo
  documentation/tutorials.

* Everything in core vxl must follow the style standards (below). The
  current vxl does not. Manchester has done a lot of work to rectify
  this, and they will incorporate the changes soon. Existing stuff
  will slowly be modified to meet the standards. New stuff must meet
  the standards in order to be accepted into the core.

* vgl needs code level and overview documentation.

* There is no vxl overview documentation, detailing the vxl
  philosophy, etc. Andrew will do this.

* sparse arrays needs tidying up. Interfaces need to be made
  consistent.
  * Manchester will fix this. The inconsistent interfaces will be
    marked deprecated (see below). They will do this only for code in
    vxl. oxl/gel people are on their own.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Coding standards:

* all global scope identifiers are lowercase with underscores separating
  words. Various reasons. Rejected vxl_Image_template by vote.

* each class, file, function and member variable should have a one
  line description (brief line) in addition to the long description.

* Private member variables should have a underscore as a suffix,
    e.g. value_. An underscore as a prefix (_value) is not
    allowed. Rejected by vote: prefix "m_", e.g. m_value.

* Accessor functions for a variable x_ should be called x() and
  set_x(). In particular
     T x;
  gives
     void set_x(T x); // or const T&, or whatever
     T x();
  (Using get_x() is redundant and simply causes extra typing.) set_x()
  should return void. It should never return the old value, as this
  could be highly confusing. Never use x() for the purposes of setting
  the value.
     void x(T val) { x_ = val; }  // WRONG!

* Avoid using nested classes where possible - there are subtle
  inconsistencies between compilers.

* Forward declarations for a class in a library val should be forward
  declared in val_fwd.h at the top level of the library. All classes
  may not be in there; only those someone feels like forward declaring
  (because it is difficult, etc.).

* Level 1 libraries should not require RTTI. High level libraries may
  use RTTI. No decision on the work-around. Tentative suggestion to
  use is_a(...) to support safe downcasting.

* A file may have more than one class, provided they "belong". The
  goal of the filename=class name is to make it easy to find
  class/function declarations and definitions. As long as this holds,
  a file may declare more than one class.

* one tab (0x08) *always* expands to 8 spaces

* Indentation:
  * may use any number of indent spaces (>=2), but must be consistent.
  * rejected proposal to fix the number of indent spaces
  * may only use spaces for indentation (i.e. no tab characters, which
    means 10 spaces of indentation may *not* be replaced by one tab
    and two spaces). Reason: Visual Studio (and other editors) allow
    the developer to set tab=n. Most people have done this to their
    own taste. These environments convert TAB to n spaces, instead of 8.
  * When editing someone else's source, you must use the same
    indentation as he.

* Maximum number of characters per line: 132. (Number extracted
  primarily from vtk guidelines). 80 character lines preferred when
  possible.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Website

* must have vxl webpage. Must find stable server name. Perhaps
  "www.visionlibraries.org"?

* vxl web presence must distinct from TJr webpage. Must make sure that
  vxl does not inherit the reputation of being hard to
  learn. targetjr.org cannot, therefore, be used.

* Proposal: SourceForge (see below).

----------------------------------------------------------------------
6. Compilation and such.

* Must make extensive use of test cases. 80% coverage (=percentage of
  code tested by the test cases) is about the best you can expect in
  practice. vnl has very good coverage (about 70%). Other libraries
  should emulate this.

* Have a compile dashboard (like vtk). The repository code is compiled
  on several platforms, and the results summarised on a webpage. Red
  boxes would provide incentive and pressure for bugs to be fixed.
  Concerns: must have a reasonable mechanism to add a new platform for
  testing when approved by the "vxl group". GE will try to get the
  first version of the dashboard up and running.
  * Dashboard should support distributed compilations.

* possibly have continuous testing. Preferably this would happen on
  the platform that gives most trouble (on HP, for example). The idea
  is that if it works on this platform, it will probably work on all
  other platforms. The other platforms are tested less regularly
  (e.g. once a day).

* Have a (moving) "last_good" cvs tag on all files when there are no
  compile/test errors.

* have a set of style tools. E.g. make sure vcl_cerr is used instead
  of cerr.

* Fred will document which parts of the C++ standard is and is not
  allowed in vxl.

* Build system must generate VC dsp files and Unix makefile. Should
  have a platform independent place to specify the project information
  (source files, etc).

* there will no longer be a distinction between local and system
  directories, as was in TJr. If a site wishes to maintain a central
  repository, symlinks can be used to fake it.

* Geoff's CMake proposal was accepted. Geoff will finish up his
  current CMake additions and present the system for testing.
  Don's makefile based system rejected because of dependencies on
  gmake and perl, for example. Ideally, a Windows user should not need
  anything outside of vxl.

* Smart pointers:
  * _ref renamed to _sptr. x_sptr should be declared in x_sptr.h. The
  renames for the files currently in the repository should be done via
  cvs add and delete.
  * _sp rejected.

* Fred presented some evidence that enabling implicit templates, on
  ELF platforms, for the STL classes, decreases the size of the
  libraries, while making template use easier. If this holds in
  general, implicit templates should be turned on system wide.
  * Should it be just for STL or for all vxl? It should be for all
    vxl, since a half-measure would probably create more confusion.
  * Implicit templates => including .hxx. How does this affect the
    compile time?
  * Decision delayed pending further (email) discussion.

* List of "supported" platforms and compilers:
    freebsd with gcc 2.95.2
    windows with intel, VC 6.0
    linux with gcc 2.95.2, 3.0, egcs 2.91.66
    Solaris with gcc 2.95.2, egcs 2.91.66
    HP with gcc 2.95.2
    Alpha with  gcc 2.95.2


----------------------------------------------------------------------
7. Class IO

* Philosophy: every class must be able to save and restore itself in a
  cross-platform manner.

* Manchester has written functionality to the current vxl for binary
  IO.
  * Uses only the public interface of the class for IO
  * Level 1 libraries written as clip-on libraries.
  * Level 2 libraries could use member functions for ease of
    implementation.
  * Manchester offers to put the code into the repository for
    promotion into vxl, subject to testing by another group.

* Decisions: basic functionality goes in a 'core' (level 1) library.
  Name to be decided (current proposal viol, could become 3-letter).

* GE is developing a general XML DTD, especially for the topology. The
  XML structure will not necessarily correspond to the vxl class
  hierarchy.

* Need proposal(s) to be decided upon before full implementation.



----------------------------------------------------------------------
8. Image processing (vipl)

* Current implementation is too complex, and therefore should be moved
  to another top level package.

* Andrew will put together templated version of vipl, while GE will
  port "float buffer" version from TJr.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
9. Topology (vtol)

* Peter presented GE's topology port from TJr. It is essentially a
  direct port. Concerns: the topology classes have knowledge of
  geometry.

* Topology should be divorced from geometry. GE and ANU will take a
  crack at developing this, and at designing a separate library to
  embed the topology in a geometry.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
10. Multi-view geometry (mvl)

* can't generalise on data structures, because they are very problem
  specific, but must come up with standardized interfaces.

* The cost of conversion from one data structure to another needs to
  be paid somewhere, either inside the library implementation or by
  the user code.

* Andrew and Richard will talk to generate some sort of general
  interface to multi-view. There will be a "mvl" mailing list (or mvl
  sublist of the vxl list) to discuss these issues.

* Oxford will put out basic multi-view algorithms (8 point algorithm,
  etc.)


----------------------------------------------------------------------
11. vtk/vxl merger:

* Would like to use vtk to display/manipulate results of vxl
  computations. GE has done some basic work, such as exchanging
  images.

* GE will work toward this. vtk & vxl will be 3rd party libraries to
  each other, so that vxl can be used without vtk.

* some libraries/routines in the vxlvtk may depend on vtk routines, in
  the same way that vnl-algo depends on netlib.

* most likely vtk will need to be installed by the user, same way as
  GTK,QT, etc, for GUI support.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
12. sourceforge and cvs mirrors

* Geoff suggested a move to the GE version of sourceforge. Sourceforge
  (www.sourceforge.org) provides a powerful interface for
  collaborative software development, and is used by many Open Source
  projects: it hosts 10500 projects and 75000 users. The sourceforge
  software itself is open source. The GE version adds functionality
  for licensing and such, and will be hosted *outside* the GE
  firewall.

* The cvs repository at Leuven is *the* repository. Mirrors (such as
  those at Oxford and RPI) are, in principle, hidden to other
  developers. That is, the burden of maintaining and syncing the
  mirror is entirely up to the group that wants the mirror.

* If the sourceforge plan should prove easy to implement, the cvs
  repository *may* need to be moved. Also, all cvs access may need to
  be through the sourceforge site.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
13. Deprecation of (public) interfaces

* Ideally, the compiler should generate a warning whenever a
  deprecated function is used. (Like Java's deprecated keyword.)  This
  is hard (impossible?) to do in C++. Options:

  * Runtime warnings only.

  * Script to check and warn for deprecated calls

  * Use //: DEPRECATED

* Deprecated interfaces *should not* immediately break user code. That
  is, deprecated interfaces should at least exist over the next
  release, giving the user time to fix his code.

* Deprecated interfaces should not exist forever, and so must be
  removed at some time. Perhaps have side-by-side releases, one with
  the deprecated interfaces + warnings, the other with such interfaces
  removed.

* Write macros vxl_compiler_warning and vxl_compiler_error (instead of
  extern "this is an error")


----------------------------------------------------------------------
14. Email discussion and voting

* Introduce an item to the mailing list, and specify a (reasonable)
  resolution date.

* All interested in the discussion will register their interest. If
  no consensus is reached by the resolution date, those with
  registered interest will vote.

* The introducer is responsible for guiding the discussion and
  providing regular summaries of current issues and stances.

* If someone is unable to participate in a discussion before or vote
  on the resolution (voting) date, and somehow (through a colleague, for
  example) indicates interest, the resolution date will be extended
  allow him to participate (=at least vote).

* The details rules should be written up and emailed to the vxl list
  for agreement.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
15. Configuration system

* things stay in place until new build system is in place

* Geoff will attempt to put the new build system config files away
  from the top level directory, to avoid conflicts with other
  libraries and build systems.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
16. vxl release

* Manchester will submit documentation changes by mid-May. Release
  soon after, when segmentation has been fully ported.

* There will be a telephone conference just before the release.

* Tentative date for the start of a coding week: June 4. The goal is
  for the groups to get together and do nothing but vxl coding. This
  will include writing documentation and maintenance changes (like
  cleanup vbl_sparse_array*).


----------------------------------------------------------------------
17. What happens with old TargetJr

* Segmentation must be ported, especially Van Duc's Canny

* No reason to rewrite "good" algorithm implementations (cf CompGeom)

* Nobody sees the need to re-implement TargetJr in terms of vil, vnl, vbl
