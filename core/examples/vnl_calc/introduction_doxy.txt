/*! \mainpage vnl_calc : a VXL example
*
* This is a command-line calculator, which can do matrix manipulation on
* matrices stored in files.  Most commonly used to invert homographies:
*
* vnl_calc file.H i
*
* It's a RPN (reverse Polish notation i.e. stack-based) calculator,
* so each operator operates on the top two elements of the stack. e.g.
*
* vnl_calc 2 3 + 4 /
*
* prints (2 + 3) / 4 = 1.25
