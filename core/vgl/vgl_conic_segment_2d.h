// \brief A curve segment with the geometry of a conic
//
// A conic segment contains those points of a given conic which lie between the
// given start point (inclusive) and the given end point, in a certain direction
// (counter-clockwise by default).
// No automatic validation checking is done for those two points effectively
// lying on the conic; this is left to the user of the class. Operations on
// vgl_conic_segment_2d<T> like intersection should actually take the "points
// closest to the given end points" as the effective end points.
//
// The concept of counter-clockwise-ness is not projectively invariant, but is
// invariant under most projective transformations that are useful in vision,
// and most certainly is under affine and Euclidean transformations. Actually,
// as long as the centre of the conic does not traverse the line at infinity,
// orientation and thus counter-clockwise-ness of the conic is kept. There is
// only one affine situation which is still ambiguous, viz. when the conic is
// a hyperbola. In that case, the definition of "counter-clockwise" is based
// --by definition-- on the view of the start point. Only when both end points
// are at infinity, i.e. when, the segment is one of the two branches of the
// hyperbola, this is still ambiguous and there is no way to distinguish which
// of the two branches is meant by just giving the two end points.
//
// The only projectively "correct" way to define a segment would be to specify
// a third point on the conic, or a direction vector from the start point.
// This would be an overkill for most applications, though.
// Those applications that require a fully projectively invariant segment should
// consider storing an additional third point together with the conic segment,
// and swap the two endpoints (by using the swap_endpoints() method) whenever
// a transformation is applied that would invert the orientation of the conic.
//
// One more ambiguous situation left is a conic segment specified by two
// identical end points. By definition, in this case, the segment only contains
// of this single point. This is compatible with the use of conic segments in
// conic fitting algorithms, where the shortest rather than the longest segment
// should be selected.
//
// When the conic is an ellipse, the semantics of the conic segment are clear:
// seen from the inside of the ellipse, and starting from the first end point,
// one goes to the left to traverse the conic segment in a counter-clockwise way.
//
// If the conic is a parabola, the first endpoint should typically lie to the
// right of the second one (as seen from the focal point of the parabola): in
// that case, the conic segment has finite length when traversed in counter-
// clockwise direction. Otherwise, we still have a valid conic segment but it
// consists of two separate, infinite branches.
//
// If the conic is a hyperbola, there are even three cases to be considered:
// if both end points lie on the same branch of the hyperbola, and the first
// one lies to the right of the second one as seen from the "inside" of that
// branch, the conic segment is a finite curve. This is the only finite case.
// By swapping the end points, the segment will have three branches, not just
// two: it will contain the two infinite fragments "outside" the end points on
// the hyperbola branch of the end points, and also the complete other branch
// of the hyperbola.
// Finally, if the end points lie on different hyperbola branches, the segment
// consists of all points to the left of the start point (as seen from the
// "inside" of the start point's branch) and of all points to the left of the
// end point (as seen from the "inside" of the end point's branch).
// In this case, swapping the end points does not change the segment! As a
// consequence, it will never be possible to specify the complement of this
// segment as a single vgl_conic_segment_2d, only as the union of two.
//
// End points can of course happily be points at infinity (if the conic is
// either a parabola or a hyperbola). A parabolic segment with the start point
// at infinity contains all points to the left of the end point, as seen from
// the focal point of the parabola. If the end point lies at infinity, it's the
// points to the left of the start point which form the segment.
// A hyperbolic segment for which the two endpoints are the two different points
// at infinity of the hyperbola, contains all points of one of the two hyperbola
// branches and none of the other branch. This is the only ambiguous situation
// so it should be avoided unless a third point is used to define the segment.
// If only one end point of a hyperbolic segment lies at infinity, the segment
// either consists of just the points to the left on the branch of the other end
// point, or of those points plus all points on the other branch.
