- In here are some basic examples to get you started using VGUI (all starting
  with basic).  Some more complicated examples (starting example) of some
  specific problems people have had with VGUI.  Also there are some examples
  using specific GUI toolkits with VGUI only drawing the OpenGL area (these
  begin with the name of the toolkit, glut, gtk, mfc).

- The lines with DOXYGEN_SHOULD_SKIP_THIS should be ignored.  They have been
  added to prevent Doxygen from generating documentation from these example
  files.
