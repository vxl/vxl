//  On exit, the values are the 8-connected distance to the

//  One pass of distance transform, going from low to high i,j.

//  is background, and zero at the places of interest.
//  On exit, the values are the 24-connected distance to the
//  nearest original zero region. (ie considers neighbours in
//  a +/-2 pixel region around each point).
//  More accurate than vil_distance_transform(image), but
//  approximately twice the processing required.
