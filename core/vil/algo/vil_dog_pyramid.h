//: Compute a pyramid of difference of gaussian images
//  Computes each layer of a pyramid by smoothing
//  then computing the difference from the original image.
//  The smoothed is then subsampled using a reduction factor of 1.5
//  (ie each level is 2/3 the size of the level below) and
//  used to produced the next level.
//
//  min_size defines the smallest dimension (restricting the number
//  of levels that will be constructed)
//
//  This is useful for finding locally interesting points and their
//  associated scales - see "Object Recognition from Scale Invariant Features"
//  D.Lowe, ICCV1999, pp.1150-1157.
