// implementations out there, in which sizeof() returns an int even though
// std::size_t is defined as long or unsigned long.  To ensure consistent results
// we always use this SIZEOF() macro in place of using sizeof() directly.

//  In typical applications, this should write the entire output buffer
//  (ignoring the current state of next_output_byte & free_in_buffer),
//  reset the pointer & count to the start of the buffer, and return TRUE
//  indicating that the buffer has been dumped.
//
//  In applications that need to be able to suspend compression due to output
//  overrun, a FALSE return indicates that the buffer cannot be emptied now.
//  In this situation, the compressor will return to its caller (possibly with
//  an indication that it has not accepted all the supplied scanlines).  The
//  application should resume compression after it has made more room in the
//  output buffer.  Note that there are substantial restrictions on the use of
//  suspension --- see the documentation.
//
//  When suspending, the compressor will back up to a convenient restart point
//  (typically the start of the current MCU). next_output_byte & free_in_buffer
//  indicate where the restart point will be if the current call returns FALSE.
//  Data beyond this point will be regenerated after resumption, so do not
//  write it out when emptying the buffer externally.
