//: Fill the input buffer --- called whenever buffer is emptied.
//
//  In typical applications, this should read fresh data into the buffer
//  (ignoring the current state of next_input_byte & bytes_in_buffer),
//  reset the pointer & count to the start of the buffer, and return TRUE
//  indicating that the buffer has been reloaded.  It is not necessary to
//  fill the buffer entirely, only to obtain at least one more byte.
//
//  There is no such thing as an EOF return.  If the end of the file has been
//  reached, the routine has a choice of ERREXIT() or inserting fake data into
//  the buffer.  In most cases, generating a warning message and inserting a
//  fake EOI marker is the best course of action --- this will allow the
//  decompressor to output however much of the image is there.  However,
//  the resulting error message is misleading if the real problem is an empty
//  input file, so we handle that case specially.
//
//  In applications that need to be able to suspend compression due to input
//  not being available yet, a FALSE return indicates that no more data can be
//  obtained right now, but more may be forthcoming later.  In this situation,
//  the decompressor will return to its caller (with an indication of the
//  number of scanlines it has read, if any).  The application should resume
//  decompression after it has loaded more data into the input buffer.  Note
//  that there are substantial restrictions on the use of suspension --- see
//  the documentation.
//
//  When suspending, the decompressor will back up to a convenient restart point
//  (typically the start of the current MCU). next_input_byte & bytes_in_buffer
//  indicate where the restart point will be if the current call returns FALSE.
//  Data beyond this point must be rescanned after resumption, so move it to
//  the front of the buffer rather than discarding it.
