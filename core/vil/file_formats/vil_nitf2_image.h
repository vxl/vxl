//: Class for reading NITF 2.1 imagery files.
// It works just like any other vil_image_resource class except that it does
// support retrieving multiple images from the same file.
// Call nimages() to find out how many images are in this resource, and then call
// set_current_image() to tell the class which image you want to work with presently.
// All regular vil_image_resource functions will operate on the current image.
//
// You can access image header information through get_image_headers() and file
// header information through get_header().
//
// Known reading limitations:
//  - The only supported compression schemes are uncompressed (all 4 different
//    types of data layouts: band sequential, band interleaved, band interleaved
//    by row, and band interleaved by pixel) and JPEG 2000 compression (via plugin).
//  Other forms of compression do not work (eg. JPEG (regular, non-j2k)
//  - Writing is unsupported at this time
//  - graphic segments are not read in
//  - text segments are not read in
//  - The class was designed to handle images with PVTYPE=C (complex), but images of
//    this type are completely untested.
//
// Things that do work:
//  - Reading uncompressed and image data (ints, shorts, 8 bit int, floats etc)
//  - parsing and validating file headers, and image headers
//  - enum_data masks (and pad pixels) are supported through vil_nitf2_data_mask_table
//  - PJUST = L
//  - Images with LUTS will read in correctly, but you will need to apply the LUT
//    yourself.  You can access the lut information for p-th band of the current image by calling
//    current_image_header()->get_lut_info(p, out_n_luts, out_ne_lut, out_lut_data)
//  - The class does not have built-in support for JPEG2000 compressed NITF files
//    Using cmake though, you can configure VXL to link against Er Mapper's freely
//    available ECW JPEG2000 SDK (http://ermapper.com/downloads/sdks.aspx#16).  If you
//    do that, then this class will automatically be able to read NITF files that are
//    JPEG 2000 compressed.

//: This function will byte align the data in in_data and store the result in out_data.
// For example, let's say that you had in_data is of type unsigned char
// and contains the following data: 110010111001111010000110.
// In other words:
// in_data[0] = 203 (11001011)
// in_data[1] = 158 (10011110)
// in_data[2] = 134 (10000110)
// Let's further say you called this function like this: byte_align_data( in_data, 8, 3, out_data ).
// Then, when the function finished, out_data would look like this:
// out_data[0] = 6 (00000110)
// out_data[1] = 2 (00000010)
// out_data[2] = 7 (00000111)
// out_data[3] = 1 (00000001)
// out_data[4] = 7 (00000111)
// out_data[5] = 2 (00000010)
// out_data[6] = 0 (00000000)
// out_data[7] = 6 (00000110)
//
// Basically, what the function did was group the bitstream into groups of three and then store all of the
// values into out_data.  It had to zero pad all the values (on the MSB side) to get them into out_data.  That's
// why out_data is bigger.
//
// This function works with other unsigned types of data too.  For example, let's say in_data was of type unsigned int
// and contained the following bits: 0100110010111000 0111101100000000 1111000011110000 (note that this bitstream is shown
// in big endian notation, that will not be the case if you are on a little endian machine -- this is just for illustration)
// in other words:
// in_data[0] = 19640 (0100110010111000) [shown in big endian for illustrative purposes only]
// in_data[1] = 31488 (0111101100000000) [shown in big endian for illustrative purposes only]
// in_data[2] = 61680 (1111000011110000) [shown in big endian for illustrative purposes only]
// Let's further say, you called this function like this byte_align_data( in_data, 4, 12, out_data ).
// Then out_data would be aligned along two byte (sixteen bit) boundaries and would look like this:
// out_data[0] = 1227 (0000010011001011) [shown in big endian for illustrative purposes only]
// out_data[1] = 2171 (0000100001111011) [shown in big endian for illustrative purposes only]
// out_data[2] = 15   (0000000000001111) [shown in big endian for illustrative purposes only]
// out_data[3] = 240  (0000000011110000) [shown in big endian for illustrative purposes only]
//
// Because of the fact that this function uses bit shifting operators, and the behavior of the std::right
// shift operator is implementation specific when applied to a negative number, you should probably
// only use this function on unsigned data.
//
// \param in_data: The input data.  It must be at least (num_samples*in_bits_per_sample\8) bytes long.
//                The values should have the endianness of your platform.
// \param num_samples: The number of actual samples in in_data.

// \param out_data: I'll store the output data here.  It must be at least (num_samples*sizeof(T)) bytes long
//                 The values will have the endianness of your platform.
//
// Note that inBitsPerSampe must not be >= sizeof(T).  If they were to be equal, then this function
// would have nothing to do (in_data is already byte aligned).  If in_bits_per_sample were less than sizeof(T),
// then each element of out_data would be too small to store the corresponding elements in in_data.
