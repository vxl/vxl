/*! \mainpage vil : Core image library
* A set of classes to represent and manipulate images
*
* \section intro Introduction
* Broadly there are two sorts of image one is interested in - images in memory
* (all parts of which can be accessed directly) and external images (eg in files)
* which can only be accessed indirectly.  In most cases images in files are loaded
* into memory in one go, where they can then be manipulated.  However, for some
* very large images this is not possible or desirable.  In this case it is useful
* to be able to load in a sub-section of the image, manipulate it, and possible
* write it out again.  vil supports both memory images and external images.
*
* The core class is vil_image_view<T> which gives a view of an image in memory.
* The only way to get at the pixel data in an image is through a vil_image_view<T>.
*
* Large images (in files) can be accessed through the vil_image_resource class,
* but one can only get at the data by asking for a view of it, which loads the
* requested section into memory and creates a suitable vil_image_view<T>.
*
* \section images Images
*
* The vil_image_view<T> represents a view of a multi-plane image of given type.
* A pointer is stored to the top-left pixel in the first plane of the image
* (top_left_ptr()) and integers indicating how to get to neighbours in
* the i (istep()), j (jstep()) and plane (planestep()) directions.
*
* The advantages of this approach are
* - It is actually faster than pointer indirection on most architectures
* - It allows one to access non-contiguous data as if it were a single plane
* - One can use it to wrap up other image classes transparently.
* - It is simple to extend to 3D images, and avoids huge arrays of pointers
*
*
* Note that the same colour image can either be viewed as a one plane image
* with RGB pixels (using vil_image_view<vil_rgb<vxl_byte> >) or as a 3 plane
* byte image (using vil_image_view<vxl_byte> with nplanes() == 3).
* \verbatim
vil_image_view<vil_rgb<vxl_byte> > rgb_image;
rgb_image = vil_load("my_image.jpg");

// Create a 3 plane view of rgb
vil_image_view<vxl_byte > three_plane_image =  rgb_image;
// or explicitly
three_plane_image =  vil_view_as_planes(rgb_image);
// or with less typing
three_plane_image = vil_load("my_image.jpg");

// Now create rgb view of 3 plane image (note: will set view to empty if not possible)
vil_image_view<vil_rgb<vxl_byte> > rgb_image2 = three_plane_image;
// or explicitly
rgb_image2 = vil_view_as_rgb(three_plane_image);

// If you want a greyscale image no matter whether the underlying image is rgb or grey
vil_image_view<vxl_byte> image2 = vil_convert_to_grey_using_average<vxl_byte>(vil_load("my_image.jpg"),vxl_byte());

\endverbatim
*
* There are some conversions that will try a fast view conversion only.
* - vil_view_as_planes(view): Create a multi-plane view from a multi-component view.
* - vil_view_as_rgb(view): Create an rgb pixel view from a multi-plane view.
* - vil_view_as_complex(view): Create a complex pixel view from a multi-plane view.
*
* There are some conversions that will process each pixel to do a conversion.
* - vil_convert_to_grey_using_average(view, new_pixel_type): Create a greyscale view from any image.
* - vil_convert_cast(source, dest): Convert, for example, a byte image to float image
*
* \subsection copying Copying
* Since the vil_image_view<T> is a `view' of the actual image data, copying one
* only copies the `view', not the image data itself - you get two views looking at
* the same chunk of memory.  Some cunning smart pointer stuff is used to ensure
* that the actual data remains as long as a valid view is looking at
* it.  (Note that this may not always be the case, since the view can be of
* a chunk of memory that the view does not have direct control of, such as a video
* buffer). This view copying will work between different types of view
* if it is possible to reconfigure the view very cheaply.
* If you wish to copy the image data itself, then use the vil_copy_deep(src_im)
* function. This copies the raw data into a newly created space, and returns
* a new view of it.  Alternatively, use the method dest_im.deep_copy(src_im),
* or the function vil_copy_reformat(src_im, dest_im).
*
*
* Example of loading, copying then processing:
* \verbatim
vil_image_view<vxl_byte> image;
image = vil_load("test_image.jpg");
vil_image_view<vxl_byte> image2 = vil_copy_deep(image);
my_invert_image(image2);
vil_save(image2,"output_image.jpg");
\endverbatim
*
* Example of creating an image in memory
* \verbatim
unsigned ni=256;
unsigned nj=256;
unsigned nplanes=3;
vil_image_view<vxl_byte> image(ni,nj,nplanes);
for (unsigned p=0;p<nplanes;++p)
  for (unsigned j=0;j<nj;++j)
    for (unsigned i=0;i<ni;++i)
      image(i,j,p) = vxl_byte(i+j+p);
\endverbatim
*
* Example of creating an image in memory, using pointer arithmetic
* \verbatim
  unsigned ni=256;
  unsigned nj=256;
  unsigned nplanes=3;
  vil_image_view<vxl_byte> image(ni,nj,nplanes);
  vxl_byte* plane = image.top_left_ptr();
  for (unsigned p=0;p<nplanes;++p,plane += image.planestep())
  {
    vxl_byte* row = plane;
    for (unsigned j=0;j<nj;++j,row += image.jstep())
    {
      vxl_byte* pixel = row;
      for (unsigned i=0;i<ni;++i,pixel+=image.istep())
        *pixel = vxl_byte(i+10*j+100*p);
    }
  }
\endverbatim
*
* \subsection set_size Resizing
* When one resizes (using set_size) a vil_image_view<T> the view disconnects from the data
* (which may then be deleted if no other views are connected), allocates a new
* chunk of memory for the new image and sets the view to look at it.
*
* Note that if the set_size does not change the image size, then nothing is done
* and the view remains unchanged.
*
* \subsection view_manipulation Manipulating Views
* There are a variety of ways one can view the same data, allowing one to appear
* to change the data simply by changing ones view of it.
*
* For instance one can obtain a transposed view of an image simply by swapping
* ni-nj and istep-jstep.  This is particularly useful when implementing
* decomposable filters, as one need only write it for one direction, then can
* apply it to the original image and its transpose.
* \verbatim
vil_image_view<vxl_byte> src_image = vil_load("image_file.jpg");
vil_image_view<vxl_byte> tmp_image1, tmp_image2;
vil_exp_filter_i(src_image, tmp_image1, 2.0);  // Apply filter to rows of src_image
vil_exp_filter_i(vil_transpose(tmp_image1), tmp_image2, 2.0);  // Apply filter to cols of tmp_image1
vil_image_view<vxl_byte> filtered_image = vil_transpose(tmp_image2);
// Note that
// vil_exp_filter_i(vil_transpose(tmp_image1),vil_transpose(filtered_image),2.0)
// would only work correctly if filtered_image was already the correct size.
// If it isn't, then the view created by vil_transpose(filtered_image) would
// be resized, and disconnected from filtered_image itself, which would remain
// unchanged.
\endverbatim
*
* View manipulations include:
* - vil_transpose     : Return transposed view
* - vil_flip_lr       : View which reflects along i (ie i -> ni-1-i left/right)
* - vil_flip_ud       : View which reflects along j (ie j -> nj-1-j up/down)
* - vil_view_as_planes: View rgb<T> data as planes of T
* - vil_view_as_rgb   : View plane data as rgb<T> pixels
* - vil_crop          : View a window into an image
* - vil_decimate      : View a trivially subsampled image
* - vil_plane         : View a single plane of an image
*
* \subsection view_ops Operations on Views
* Useful simple operations on views include
* - vil_print_all(os,view)         : Prints out view in a grid
* - vil_fill(view,value)           : Fills view with value
* - vil_fill_row(view,j,value)     : Fills row j with value
* - vil_fill_col(view,i,value)     : Fills col i with value
* - vil_fill_mask(view,mask,value) : Fills region defined by boolean mask image
* - vil_fill_disk(view,ci,cj,r,val): Fills disk in image with value
* - vil_clamp                      : Clamp image pixels to given range
* - vil_histogram_equalise(image)  : Apply histogram equalisation
*
* \subsection vil_image_view_base_sptr
* These are used internally by vil, and are not intended for users of vil.
* Anywhere you see a function returning one of
* these, (e.g. vil_load() ) you can assign it directly to a vil_image_view<T>. If
* you want a pixel-type independent image container, see vil_memory_image below.
*
* \section image_src Image resources
* The vil_image_resource class is an abstract base class for image data, views
* of which can be obtained (or changed) with the get_view()/put_view() functions. You
* cannot directly construct one of these vil_image_resource classes. Instead you use a
* helper function, which will return a smart pointer - expect to see lots of vil_image_resource_sptr
* objects.
* The types of derived classes, and means of creating them are
* - Representing an image in a file: e.g. vil_pnm_image, vil_jpeg_image. These are
*   created using vil_load_image_resource(), and vil_new_image_resource()
* - vil_memory_image: Representing an image in memory (essentially a wrapper around a view.)
*   This is created using vil_new_image_resource() or vil_new_image_resource_of_view().
* - Representing a filtered version of an image in a file (without loading in memory): e.g.
*   vil_crop_image_resource and vil_decimate_image_resource. These are created using the
*   equivalent functions: vil_crop(), vil_decimate(), etc.
* - Representing the outcome of an image processing algorithm (see next section)
*   e.g. vil_convolve_1d_resource. These are created using the equivalent functions
*   vil_convolve_1d().
*
* vil_image_resource objects in most cases only deal with scalar-type pixels.
* Of course once you get a view of real image data in memory, you can easily
* convert a multi-planar view into a multi-component view.
*
* \section Legacy interfaces
*
* There are two reasons to still use vil1 (currently core/vil1)
* - vil1 has one or two image processing functions and image loaders that have yet to be ported to vil
* - You may have lots of code that uses vil1, and haven't yet converted to vil.
*
* There are several functions to convert between the various types of vil1 and vil images.
* - vil_vil1_to_image_resource(vil1_image): creates a vil_image_resource.
* - vil_vil1_to_image_view(vil1_memory_image_of<T>): creates a vil_image_view<T>.
* - vil_vil1_from_image_view(vil_image_view<T>): creates a vil1_memory_image_of<T>.
*

* For your ease of use, all vil functions and methods adhere to the following
* parameter conventions:
* - Index types         - All pixel index and image size types are unsigned.
* - Specifying a pixel  - func(i,j) assumes plane 0 or func(i,j,p)
* - Specifying a window - func(i0,ni,j0,nj) window includes all planes.
*
* \section Examples Examples
* There are plenty of working examples in the examples subdirectory - these can
* be treated as a mini-tutorial.
