//: Representation of a pyramid resolution hierarchy; mostly pure virtual methods
//
// The pyramid consists of a set of scaled (lower resolution) copies of the base
// image.  A typical case is where the copies are each a factor of two smaller
// than the next lower image in the pyramid. However, there is no intrinsic
// assumption about the scale difference between copies at different levels.
//
// All image positions and sizes are expressed in the coordinate system of
// the base image. The transformation from base image coordinates to one
// of the copy images is given by:  ic = ib*scale, jc = jb*scale. Thus the
// base image is considered to have scale = 1.0.
// The copies all have scale<1.0.
