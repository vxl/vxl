// \brief Representation of a pyramid hierarchy of image views.
//        The images can be passed to the view (in this case they are any
//        size or scale but sorted based on the scale in the descending order,
//        or can be generated in here (default case).
//        By default: the levels of views are half the size of the previous
//        level and image scales are in the descending order. The biggest image
//        is at level 0 and with scale 1.0 (1,1.0), and the next levels goes like:
//        (1,0.5), (2,0.25) etc..
