// \brief An abstract base class for all lens distortions.
// \author Matt Leotta

//
//   A lens distortion is a 2D warping of the image plane to account for lens effects
//   not accounted for by the simple camera models.  It is assumed that the map is
//   bijective, though a closed form solution for the inverse may not exist in general.
//   A default iterative solver is provided to solve for the inverse mapping.
//   Currently the iterative solver has only been implemented for the specialized
//   radial symmetric case in derived class vpgl_radial_distortion.
