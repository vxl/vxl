//: A binary output adaptor for any std::ostream
// Currently the main use of this is to encourage streams to be opened
// in binary mode (ie. without CR/LF conversion)
//
// This class also provide basic support for serialisation. This allows an
// object which has multiple pointers to it to be saved only once. During
// reloading, the pointers can be all set up again to point to the single
// object. vsl_b_ostream does not do the serialisation itself, but instead
// keeps records of unique identifiers to allow the user's code to perform
// serialisation safely. For instance, a smart pointer type object will have
// to know how to safely save whatever it is pointing to.

// Visual Studio .NET on a 32-bit platform can check for 64-bit

// keyword suppresses that warning here, because it's not a problem.
// On a real 64-bit platform, there will presumably be an overloaded
// vsl_b_write for the 64-bit integral type. We don't want to suppress
// the warning (C4244) completely, because it is a useful warning.
// 08/20/2003: Added macro that defines whether or not attribute needs
//             to be used. A new version of MS .NET compiler required this change.
//             Add compilers as needed. This could be moved to vcl_compiler.h.
