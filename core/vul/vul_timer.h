// \brief A timing facility for C++
// \author This code was originally written by Joe Rahmeh at UT Austin.
//
// The vul_timer class provides an interface to system timing.
// It allows a C++ program to record the time between  a  reference
// point (mark) and now. This class uses the system
// time(2) interface to provide time resolution at either
// millisecond  or microsecond granularity, depending upon
// operating system support and features. Since the time duration  is
// stored  in  a  32-bit  word,  the maximum time period before
// rollover occurs is about 71 minutes.
//
// Due to operating system dependencies, the  accuracy  of  all
// member  function results may not be as documented. For  example,
// some operating  systems  do  not  support  timers  with
// microsecond  resolution. In those cases, the values returned
// are provided to the nearest millisecond  or  other  unit  of
// time  as  appropriate. See the Timer header file for system
// specific notes.
//
// The Timer class provides timing code for performance evaluation.
//  - User time:   time cpu spends in user mode on behalf of the program.
//  - System time: time cpu spends in system mode on behalf of the program.
//  - Real time:   what you get from a stop watch timer.
