# define the libraries and package dependencies for doc generation
# Format:
# Package Library Prefix [build/ignore] dependencies
#  - If the fourth field is "ignore" the library will not be built,
#    but will be considered when building a list of dependencies.
#    (Provided for testing, and to allow a single library to be built alone)
# The dependencies, which are used build links between the html for each library,
# are transitive. So if B depends on A, and C depends on A and B,
# then C need only list A
